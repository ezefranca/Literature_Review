abstract = {Nowadays, food wastage and childhood obesity are major issues. They are not only related to published health and economic matters but are also associated with the exhaustion of the environment and available natural resources. Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Globally, in 2016 the number of overweight children under the age of five was estimated to be over 41 million. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. In this context, the Green Deal and the “Farm to Fork” strategies introduced by the European Commission in 2020 support actions that can reduce food waste and change eating behavior to achieve a more sustainable society. One way to make children more aware of the environment and induce them to eat healthier food in the future is the introduction of educational games made by food waste through which they learn the importance of the environment and the health impact of the food they eat. This chapter describes an example of a food product designed for children, which, in the future, might help them to experience something educational and fun while taking care of a plant and watching it grow. It is also an opportunity to teach them to respect and care about the environment and follow a sustainable healthy diet when adults.}

abstract = {Food waste from institutional food services accounts for a significant part of global food waste. Food waste sorting (FWS) at the source reduces waste management costs and environmental impacts in organizations. Yet what drives individual FWS behavior remains underexplored. This study explores the psychological process of FWS in institutional catering environments, integrating the value-belief-norm model, the theory of planned behavior, and self-determination theory. Data were collected from 431 university students in China and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results indicated the interplay of values, beliefs, norms, and motivations in shaping FWS behaviors. Social value orientations (SVO) indirectly affected FWS through awareness of consequences and personal norms. Subjective norms, potentially attributed to external regulations in canteens, influenced FWS intention through personal norms and induced FWS primarily via controlled motivations. The findings imply that behavioral strategies to induce FWS may leverage social influence and external regulation while also translating values and knowledge into intrinsic motivations through educational programs and awareness campaigns.}

abstract = {Satisfying the consumer is the ultimate goal of postharvest handling. To best understand the challenges in handling of fresh fruits and vegetables, it helps to trace those items in the home back through retail outlets, food service providers, distribution centers, transport, packing, harvest, and production practices. Unlike a supply chain which seeks to optimize efficiency between harvest and market, a value chain seeks to deliver high-quality product to the market. Of increasing interest in the management of postharvest chains is sustainability of produce from farm to market and reduction of food waste. Challenges in handling within a value chain include marketing equitably, handling items in stores, ensuring food safety, developing quality management plans, coping with constrained handling, minimizing physiological stress, and understanding transitions at purchase and harvest. Management programs must include an understanding of product flow from farm to home as well as money flow back through the chain. Simulation models (games) have been developed to better understand these flows and how to improve postharvest handling of fresh produce using systems-thinking practices.}

abstract = {Conscious, collective, and repetitive behaviours, lead people to select, consume, and use certain foods or diets, in response to social and cultural influences as well as the fact that food habits in childhood determine food habits in adulthood. The development of these food habits during childhood depends on family, culture, familiarity, and accessibility, among other factors. Likewise, seeking attractive approaches for children, based on gamification and the use of new technologies and challenges, to transfer content and knowledge can guide their behaviour towards healthier and more sustainable food choices. A platform consisting in an interactive place where children can learn about food by playing will be developed and tested focused on kids and on their parents or caretakers. The platform will include different modules which will provide information regarding nutrition, sustainability, food waste, food science, sensory properties of food and technology specifically for children and adults. The use of chatbots for educational purposes is a recent topic that has been widely discussed and some examples support its development. There is a wide range of topics that can be addressed through chatbots so the tool will use the potential of chatbots so that children can learn the basics of healthy nutritional and sustainable habits from an early age, using a specific language according to their age range and understanding. To ensure that the tool and the AI behind it are adapted to the stage of development of children from different countries and provide the appropriate content, parents, caregivers, and other stakeholders as well as children themselves were consulted in Finland, Poland, and Spain to co-create the best solution. Therefore, cocreation activities were carried out with children, parents, and stakeholders using validated questionnaires, qualitative methodologies of co-creation or open in-depth interviews in these UE countries.}

abstract = {The agri-food supply chain involves multiple entities and confronts unique barriers resulting in large environmental effects. Each entity has different and conflicting interests in sustainability, particularly within the echelon of the chain. Considering the Circular Food Economy (CFE) as a potential solution, this study proposes the basic structure of a biform game. This hybrid game theory approach considers the strategy decisions of players about circularity as the noncooperative side in the first stage, whereas the cooperative side refers to the distribution of CFE benefits by forming vertical alliances in the second stage. The arguments and detailed explanations are presented.}
