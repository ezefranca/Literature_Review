	abstract = {Food waste is a significant worldwide issue in landfill management. Due to improper implementation, technology applications related to food waste collection and its management system are still lacking in practice. The available applications have yet to address the issue of food waste management. Constructing an interactive mobile application is necessary for managing food waste collection for the decomposition process using Black Soldier Fly (BSF) treatment. Furthermore, as the mobile application requires participation from various user backgrounds, maintaining user involvement has become a priority. Gamification has emerged as one of the approaches that might favourably affect individual engagement behaviour. A comprehensive game element design is required where it focuses on how gamification can influence user engagement. This study aims to model the food waste gamified mobile application design to benefit Malaysia's decomposition ecosystem. It includes gamification, management features, and data visualization for reporting and will involve users from households, businesses, and the BSF farm. This paper presents the modelling process of a new mobile application design for this concept of study. The UX agile approach was used in gathering and designing the application requirements as it allows for active participation from all stakeholders. The result shows that the experts agree on the application design. This research will indirectly benefit the BSF industry in Malaysia, and it will have a significant impact on gamification, user experience, and food waste management in the direction of a sustainable environment. © 2022.

	abstract = {Objective: Previously published versions of the healthy eating FIT Game were administered by teachers in all grades at elementary schools. The present study evaluated whether the game would retain its efficacy if teachers were relieved of this task; presenting instead all game materials on visual displays in the school cafeteria. Materials and Methods: Participants were 572 children attending two Title 1 elementary schools (grades K-5). Following a no-intervention baseline period in which fruit and vegetable consumption were measured from food waste, the schools played the FIT Game. In the game, the children's vegetable consumption influenced events in a good versus evil narrative presented in comic book-formatted episodes in the school cafeteria. When daily vegetable-consumption goals were met, new FIT Game episodes were displayed. Game elements included a game narrative, competition, virtual currency, and limited player autonomy. The two intervention phases were separated by a second baseline phase (within-school reversal design). Simulation Modeling Analysis (a bootstrapping technique appropriate to within-group time-series designs) was used to evaluate whether vegetable consumption increased significantly above baseline levels in the FIT Game phases (P < 0.05). Results: Vegetable consumption increased significantly from 21.3 g during the two baseline phases to 42.5 g during the FIT Game phases; a 99.9% increase. The Game did not significantly increase fruit consumption (which was not targeted for change), nor was there a decrease in fruit consumption. Conclusion: Labor-reductions in the FIT Game did not reduce its positive impact on healthy eating. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Based on the status quo of festival food waste, we designed a conservation-oriented supply chain, which is a single-cycle food supply chain with two players, including one retailer and one supplier. The retailer, as a follower of the Stackelberg game, can receive the product from the supplier in two ways: at the wholesale price or as a call option. Meanwhile, there are two production modes of the product line: slow and rapid. When the retailer has determined the strike amount, under the early slow production mode, it is difficult to meet the rapid demand for festival food, and the supplier will shift to the rapid production mode. By the nature of the product, there is a certain deterioration rate. Furthermore, the demand achieves a maximum value before the festival, after which the demand plummets. Under the above conditions, we explore the optimal production strategy and the optimal pricing strategy. By comparing the forward contracts under the two benchmarks of centralized supply chains, and decentralized supply chains, our results indicate that, in a decentralized supply chain system, the optimal strike price, wholesale price, and option price are influenced by the retail price, food deterioration rate, and relevant cost. The discount price has no effect on the optimal price. Optimal profit is negatively correlated with demand risk, spoilage rate and production costs, and positively correlated with out-of-stock costs. Through the risk-sharing mechanism of an option contract, both the retailer and the supplier reduce their business risk. In addition, the decentralized supply chain's optimal profit value can be coordinated to the centralized supply chain profit value under certain conditions. © 2021},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a quantum game to study the food loss and waste (FLW) reduction in a two-echelon food supply chain (FSC) consisting of single supplier and single retailer. First, a Non-zero-sum game model based on the efforts of supplier and retailer in the process of FLW reduction is developed. Then, the classic strategy space is extended to quantum strategy space. The results show that in both classical environment and the separable quantum game scenario, it is difficult to achieve the Pareto optimal strategy of the two parties adopting the full effort strategy, because the full-effort party will bear the risk of betrayal by the non-effort party. However, in the context of maximally entangled quantum game, the risk causing by the non-effort party are borne by himself rather than the full-effort party. Correspondingly, both parties will adopt the full effort strategy to achieve a win-win situation and improve FLW in FSC significantly. Furthermore, an entanglement contract is proposed to ensure that neither of them has the motivation to deviate from the quantum strategy. Based on these findings, some managerial implications are presented to improve the level of cooperation and effort of the supplier and the retailer on FLW reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Separate collection of valuables from waste is of growing importance for the conservation of resources and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. Moreover, the separation of certain waste fractions, such as food waste, is necessary to ensure that landfills and – more importantly – incinerators are managed properly. It is therefore necessary to examine the reasons and motivations for separating waste. Separation and recycling of waste fractions should decrease the overall cost of waste disposal for citizens and public bodies. This can only happen if the authorities take into consideration some important “stumbling blocks,” i.e. physical and socioeconomic indicators and prerequisites, when introducing a recycling system. Four examples (landfill tax as an incentive for separate collection, recycling of used paper and cardboard, collection of bio-waste, recycling of mixed packaging waste) have been investigated in order to evaluate the reasons for successful and unsuccessful attempts at resource recovery. Economic incentives for waste segregation are very important and should be tested in pilot studies or through simulation games, because major differences between opportunity costs and costs for alternative treatment options may lead to unwanted behavior by waste producers and/or citizens. Furthermore, citizens’ behavior regarding the separation of valuables, their cultural background with respect to waste management, and social norms must be taken into account when planning collection schemes. Obviously, convenient access to collection systems is essential. Citizens must become accustomed to these systems; long-term awareness raising helps to optimize the successful collection of recyclables. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

However, previous studies on serious supply chain games have not adequately addressed specific issues related to food products, such as supply-side fluctuations, dynamic pricing to balance fluctuating supply and demand, perishability of goods, dependence of the value of goods on the remaining life, delivery and sell-by deadlines, life-based discounting, and food loss reduction. In this study, we developed a new serious game for supply chains called the Milky Chain Game, which incorporates these food-product-specific issues. The game was tested on university students, and its educational effectiveness was examined. The results showed that the participants who were conscious of reducing food loss experienced a persistent undersupply of milk cartons in the game experiments, highlighting the challenge of balancing food loss reduction and consumer satisfaction. In the post-hoc questionnaire, six out of 10 participants expressed a desire to play the game again, indicating they had a positive impression of the Milky Chain Game. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

In this chapter, we use the example of a sustainable food system to illustrate the idea of a circular economy to real-world situations. Additionally, we investigate the shift to a circular alimentary system using the socio-technical transformation paradigm to sustainability. The food sector is anticipated to expand output as a result of estimates for global population expansion, which in turn will undoubtedly result in a rise in the total amount of waste produced. Considering this background, the formation of low-cost, eco-friendly materials is essential to sustainably cope up with energy demands. Hence, it is high time to adopt the circular economy principles in the plastic sector. The game-changing approach is to support and promote sustainable polymer technologies that separate plastics from fossil feedstocks. As a result, it can reduce packaging waste, enhance packaging design, and push for the adoption of bio-based, biodegradable, and compostable plastics. The current study focuses on effective approaches in the circular economy, especially the application of bio-polymer-based coatings and emulsions in food technology. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Surinder Singh, Suresh Sundaramurthy, Alex Ibhadon, Faisal Khan, Sushil Kumar Kansal, and S.K.

	abstract = {This research presents a quasi-experiment utilizing an original card-game to investigate aspects implicated in the creation of food waste in the UK, including over purchasing due to a lack of advanced planning as well as susceptibility to advertising multi-buy offers. A card game embedding a clear trade-off between the temptation of additional gain and the risk of waste was devised. Decisions to purchase different multi-buy offers were recorded across individual and group decision-making. The results indicate that collaborative purchase decision-making could have some impact on the way in which the risk of waste is dealt with, consistent with social signaling and collective action. Compared to individual decision-making, group decision-making saw a deferral in choices to purchase multi-buy offers with an associated risk of wastefulness wen only a moderate temptation was added. These differences were embedded in both planned strategies and revealed behavior. Food waste is linked to marketing practices as well as household routines and perceived levels of control, particularly amongst households with multiple young adults. Shopping is typically conducted as an individual, however collaborative shopping experiences may help with planning and control, particularly amongst a student population. © 2018},

	abstract = {Purpose: Currently, digital technology has been proposed as a new archetype for developing an effective traceability system in the perishable food supply chain (FSC). Implementation of such a system needs significant investment and the burden lies with the members of the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact on the profit of the supply chain members due to the implementation of an effective traceability system with such a large investment. The study also tries to explore the impact of the implementation of such a system by coordination among the members through a cost-sharing mechanism. Design/methodology/approach: A two-level supply chain that comprises a supplier and retailer is analyzed using a game-theoretic approach. The mathematical models are developed considering the scenario for an individual, centralized and both members invest using a cost-sharing mechanism. For each of the models, the impact of product selling price, information sensing price and quality improvement level on profit is analyzed through numerical analysis. Findings: The study reveals that consumer involvement can be a strong motivation for the supply chain members to initiate investment in the traceability system. Further, from an investment perspective cost-sharing model is beneficial compared to the individual investment-bearing model. This mechanism can coordinate as well as benefit the FSC members. However, the model is less beneficial to the centralized model from profit and quality improvement levels. Practical implications: Food wastage can be less from supplier and retailer perspectives. Moreover, consumers can purchase food items only after verifying their shipping conditions. Consequently the food safety scandals can be reduced remarkably. Originality/value: Digital technology adoption in the perishable FSC is still considered emerging. The present study helps organizations to implement a traceability system in the perishable FSC through consumer involvement and a cost-sharing mechanism. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, the effect of relaxing the limits was found to vary depending on some conditions. Thus, to further understand how these limits affect food wastage, we take a game-theoretical analysis approach. In this approach, we formulate a normal-form game played by a manufacturer and a retailer in a milk supply chain, develop a simulation model of the chain, and use the simulator to obtain sample values of the players’ payoffs earned under every pair of their strategies. We then apply a statistical multiple comparison test to the data to identify the statistical best responses of a player to each opponent strategy, derive statistical Nash equilibriums, and compare the equilibriums obtained under different limits and consumers’ preferences. Consequently, it is confirmed that relaxing the limits may undesirably impact food waste. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

This discrete ranking creates ‘winners’ at the top (the challengers that prevent food waste by generating demand for it), who respond enthusiastically to the food waste hierarchy to benefit from status gains. In contrast, the ‘losers’ at the bottom (biogas plants) show very little interest in improving their position. They do not see themselves as players in such a competitive game and direct their attention towards other competitions outside the field. The chapter argues that ranks do not necessarily induce competition, since the actors may be involved in multiple competitions and decide whether it is worth pursuing high status within each one. © the several contributors 2021.},

To better meet customers' safety and quality expectations and reduce the loss of problematic products that fail to be recalled in time, the paper establishes a two-level food supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and supplier, uses the Stackelberg game to explore the interaction between traceability recall and product safety optimization in the food chain, and finds the best food safety investment and product traceability recall strategy. And we consider the case of the former investing in the latter's product safety efforts. The results show that the food safety premium sharing rate determines the optimal decision of manufacturers and suppliers when each member is faced with the difference between the loss cost of unrecalled food per unit and the traceable recall cost coefficient. In addition, the higher safety investment cost factor increases the burden on the entire supply chain and reduces the safety benefits of the food chain. Moreover, higher security investment cost factors increase the burden on the entire supply chain and reduce the safety benefits of the food chain. Interestingly, suppliers can take advantage of the increased cost per unit of unrecalled products to obtain higher safety investments when manufacturers implement recall measures for problematic foods. We also introduced blockchain technology and discovered Pareto optima for food safety. When the supplier bears part of the problem of food loss, food safety, quality, and investment are high. The conclusions show that product traceability recall is beneficial to the overall welfare of the food chain. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This study considers the operational characteristics of food waste generators (FWGs) and food WTE firms in China, with an evolutionary game model constructed to analysis their interactive behaviours and strategic preferences. The results suggest that lowering the gate fee and increasing the punishment cost while setting a recovery cap could prevent the originally eco-friendly WTE program from being more wasteful, which is conducive to reducing waste generation and enhance energy utilisation simultaneously. There exists Liebig's law, i.e., by increasing the level of constraint (Average revenue of food waste recovered or punishment cost) could shift other evolutionary stable strategies (ESSs) towards the ideal ESS. We also provide scientific and feasible approaches for government to undertake and improve its charging policy. Our findings guide countries suffering from waste disposal and energy shortage on effective and efficient food waste management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Food waste presents a substantial challenge with significant environmental and economic ramifications, and its severity on campus environments is of particular concern. In response to this, we introduce FoodWise, a dual-component system tailored to inspire and incentivize campus communities to reduce food waste. The system consists of a data storytelling dashboard that graphically displays food waste information from university canteens, coupled with a mobile web application that encourages users to log their food waste reduction actions and rewards active participants for their efforts. Deployed during a two-week food-saving campaign at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in March 2023, FoodWise engaged over 200 participants from the university community, resulting in the logging of over 800 daily food-saving actions. Feedback collected post-campaign underscores the system's efficacy in elevating user consciousness about food waste and prompting behavioral shifts towards a more sustainable campus. This paper also provides insights for enhancing our system, contributing to a broader discourse on sustainable campus initiatives. © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {The tradition of marketing only aesthetically agreeable produce by retailers contributes to a major source of food loss through “ugly veg”, i.e., the produce that does not look “regular”. In this paper, we examine the relations between different tiers of agri-food supply chains to study the impact of marketing ugly veg on different supply chain members and the food loss in the system. We examine and compare scenarios of a centralized supply chain, a traditional supply chain without ugly veg, an ugly veg supply chain with a single retailer offering both regular produce and ugly veg, and a two-retailer supply chain where an auxiliary retailer sells the ugly veg. We characterize the equilibrium decisions in these systems and also provide analytical results and insights on the effectiveness of different supply chain designs based on a comprehensive numerical study. We demonstrate the conditions under which the supply chain can reduce overall food loss. For sufficiently high cost of effort, selling ugly veg through the single retailer reduces food loss. Nonetheless, the grower is generally better off offering the ugly veg to an auxiliary retailer. We show that the ratio of food loss per cultivated land always decreases in the two-retailer supply chain, while the total food loss might increase for sufficiently high cost of effort. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {It is estimated that during FY 2018, food waste of 25.31 million tons and food loss of 6 million tons occurred in Japan. Of this total amount, 3.24 million tons of waste was generated from business, including the food manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and restaurant industries, and 2.76 million tons of waste was generated from households. Thus, it is crucial to mitigate both upstream and downstream food loss. As consumption patterns greatly influence not only downstream but also upstream food loss, special emphasis must be placed on increasing consumers’ awareness of this global issue, and several programs have been initiated to this end. Our research reveals that alongside awareness, enhancing consumers’ skills is of vital importance to efficiently reduce downstream food loss. Additionally, business operators must invest in improving the skills of those in charge to mini-mize food loss in commercial setups. Educating both consumers and businesses with the requisite skills to lessen food loss is equally essential. The authors are developing impactful serious games to help impart such education. These include a vegetable supply chain game (Veggie Mart Game), where consumers are players, and a milk supply chain game (Milky-Chain Game), where businesses are players.

	abstract = {This paper examines the food waste separation initiative during the 29th Southeast Asia (SEA) Games. The study was conducted through a combination of survey questionnaires, focus interviews and observations, with the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as the theoretical background. In particular, 267 samples were analysed in relation to the qualitative responses of eight student volunteers obtained through a focus group interview; thus facilitating a comparative analysis between self-reported data and the observed behaviour of waste separation. The gap addressed is the lack of studies on recycling behaviour premised on such comparison. From the self-reported data, most participants professed pro-environmental attitudes and claimed to have used the food waste bin at Bukit Jalil National Stadium (Bukit Jalil). However, the observed behaviour showed limited food waste separation and widespread contamination. The prevalence of environmental message at Bukit Jalil had arguably pressured most participants into expressing socially desirable responses, thus resulting in an attitude-behaviour gap. Most participants were not astute to the operational errors in the recycling programme, namely the inconsistencies in the bin system and colour-coding. This would suggest the lack of recycling information and recycling skills, which coupled with the errors in recycling infrastructure, lowered the perceived behavioural control of food waste separation at Bukit Jalil. Experimental intervention was conducted, whereby volunteers closely supervised two food waste bins and assisted in the food waste separation process. It was found that high visibility of recycling behaviour exerted significant pressure on the spectators to separate food waste. The theoretical implication is the exposition of subjective norms as a determinant that influence an individual's professed attitudes towards the behaviour, in addition to influencing the behavioural intention. The managerial implication lies in demonstrating that the visibility of recycling behaviour reinforces the social pressure of recycling norm. The findings can be applied in the design of recycling stations with the view to improve recycling rate. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Public engagement with waste sorting is crucial to the diversion of solid waste from landfill and the reduction of contamination in waste streams. The current study aims to promote recycling and composting accuracy via a digital sorting game that provides immediate feedback. In this game, participants manually sorted items into four bins (food scraps, recyclable container, paper, and garbage) via a computer interface, and received immediate feedback on their performance after each trial. We found that immediate feedback improved sorting accuracy as measured by correct key presses (Experiment 1) or motion trajectory (Replication 1), even when feedback was no longer provided. This improvement in sorting accuracy remained a week after playing the game (Replication 2). We then implemented this game in residences, and found that after residents played this game, the weight of compost materials increased while the contamination rate decreased (Experiment 2). These findings suggest that providing immediate feedback in a digital sorting game can be an effective tool to engage and educate the public to increase recycling and composting rates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Discussing how to more successfully implement PAFW to reduce food waste is of great significance in achieving sustainable development.

A simulation-based approach is used to validate the theoretical results and analyze the influence of key parameters on the evolutionary trajectory. The study found the following: (1) to promote the system to an optimal evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), it is necessary to strengthen policy publicity, increase the willingness of large supermarkets to implement the PAFW, and increase the enthusiasm of the public or third-party organizations to monitor system; (2) stakeholders' initial willingness will influence the evolutionary trajectory; and (3) it is important to strengthen the institutional development of local government regulators, improve the local government's achievements, reduce the local government's regulatory costs, improve policies to support large supermarkets' implementation of the PAFW, and reduce the cost of implementing the PAFW for large supermarkets.  © 2021 Xichun Luo and Honghao Zhao.},

This study highlights the importance of food traceability in reducing food loss through the proper monitoring of food at every stage of the supply chain. The actions of individual players in a food supply chain affect its traceability. Moreover, the decisions made by one player influence the decisions of the other players. Thus, traceability becomes more complex as the number of players increases. Owing to the complex nature of a food chain, it is important to analyze all the possible strategies that stakeholders consider and understand the influence of those possible strategies on the traceability of a food supply chain. In this study, we deploy a game theory model to analyze the strategic combinations of all possible actions of different stakeholders to understand the complexities present in a food supply chain, as well as how these strategic combinations help in decision-making for the adoption of traceability in a food supply chain. Furthermore, we analyze the factors that may increase or decrease the probability of adopting traceability in a food supply chain. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Twenty percent of all global greenhouse emissions are food-related. Tourism and hospitality contribute significantly, with food accounting for nearly half of the waste these sectors produce. One type of food waste – plate waste – could easily be avoided. Plate waste is the food people leave behind uneaten on their plates. It does not increase the enjoyment of the meal, yet costs the hotel money, and harms the environment. We develop and test – in a quasi-experimental field study – a game-based intervention that reduces plate waste by 34 percent, and is available for immediate adoption by hotels globally. Our study contributes to theory by demonstrating the power of increasing pleasure in pleasure-seeking contexts when aiming to change environmentally significant tourist behaviour. Our findings also challenge established behavioural theories, which postulate that people's beliefs are the key drivers of pro-environmental behaviour. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {This research explores the value of data sharing in a two-echelon, fresh product supply chain consisting of a retailer and manufacturer. Demand is stochastic and price sensitive. Decision-making is decentralized and the supply chain operates with a simple linear wholesale price contract. We employ a game theoretic model in which the manufacturer is a Stackelberg leader. Although fresh product supply chains are ubiquitous in the marketplace, academic guidance is limited, particularly in the context of data sharing and when price is determined endogenously. Our analysis shows that although data sharing helps to improve product freshness and reduce waste, sufficiently improved product freshness is the key for both suppliers and retailers to benefit financially. Otherwise, either party or the entire supply chain can be worse off. We demonstrate that data sharing is most valuable when product is somewhat perishable and demand is volatile. For highly perishable or non-perishable products, the manufacturer benefits but the retailer is harmed. Our results suggest that the drivers that motivate retailers to share inventory data in a fresh product supply chain are distinct from extant knowledge. The results provide insight into strategies that not only improve both parties’ performance, but also reduce food waste at the same time. © 2022},

	abstract = {Gamification refers to the application of gaming concepts in non-playful contexts to encourage engagement with a product or service. Gameful systems are software programs that embed this concept and are increasingly being applied in various fields, such as environmental awareness, education and training, health, and food waste reduction. These systems are based on a set of rules defined by game designers, who specify the conditions that must be met to evolve the state of a game and the associated consequences. However, the current approaches to defining rules in gameful systems carry certain limitations that can give rise to undesirable or unforeseen behaviors. These limitations pose significant challenges to the smooth functioning and overall effectiveness of gameful experiences. This paper presents a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed to simplify and strengthen the entire rule lifecycle process. The DSL guides designers during the rule definition process using easy-to-use fluent APIs. Additionally, it enables the simulation of rules and verification of their behavior through a graph that explicitly shows their interconnection. Finally, the DSL facilitates the deployment of rules on the gamification engine with simple steps. This approach enhances the effectiveness of gameful systems by reducing the likelihood of unintended consequences and improving the overall user experience.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Human missions to establish surface habitats on the Moon and Mars are planned in the coming decades. Extraplanetary surface habitat life support systems (LSS) will require new capabilities to withstand anticipated unique, harsh conditions. In order to provide safe, habitable environments for the crew, water purification systems that are robust and reliable must be in place. These water purification systems will be required to treat all sources of water in order to achieve the necessary levels of recovery needed to sustain life over the long-duration missions. Current water recovery and purification systems aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are only partially closed, requiring external inputs and resupply. Furthermore, organic wastes, such as fecal and food wastes, are currently discarded and not recycled. For long-duration missions and habitats, this is not a viable approach. The inability to recycle organic wastes represents a lost opportunity to recover critical elements (e.g., C, H, O, N, P) for subsequent food production, water purification, and atmospheric regeneration. On Earth, a variety of technologies are available to meet terrestrial wastewater treatment needs; however, these systems are rarely completely closed-loop, due to lack of economic drivers, legacy infrastructure, and the (perceived) abundance of resources on Earth. Extraplanetary LSS provides a game-changing opportunity to incentivize the development of completely closed-loop systems. Candidate technologies may be biological, physical, or chemical, with associated advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents a survey of potential technologies, along with their inputs, outputs and requirements, which may be suitable for next-generation regenerative water purification in space. With this information, particular technologies can be down-selected for subsystem integration testing and optimization. In order for future space colonies to have closed-loop systems which minimize consumable inputs and maximize recovery, strategic implementation of a variety of complementary subsystems is needed. © 2019 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR)},

	abstract = {With the expansion of urbanization, we are witnessing the growing uncertainty in municipal food demand leading to an increase in urban waste. With the motive of producing organic fertilizers and conserving the environment, expired food can be collected and recycled. This study examines the hypothesis that leasing recycling facilities from peri-urban areas, due to the ban on reproduction operations in the city centers, can manage the recycling system participants’ relationship and enhance sustainability in urban communities. The problem has been investigated under two separate sources of uncertainty, namely, quality and capacity. In the first scenario, a recycling system consisting of a commercial food service located in urban areas, a food waste collection agency, and a suburban fertilizer factory is optimized, in which the commercial food service leases the fertilizer factory’s facilities for recycling operations. In the second scenario, the two factories’ relationship, in which the first factory can rent the second factory’s facilities in case of capacity shortage, is managed through hybrid contracts and mathematical programming models. The results show that the whole system optimization and Pareto Improvement results for all members are guaranteed under proposed hybrid contracts. These conclusions can help food recycling system managers have a better relationship with other players in their supply chains and enhance their credibility for caring about the environment, social concerns, and government compliance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Persuasive technologies have been used successfully in several domains including health to make people exercise more, shopping to make people buy specific products, and social media to make people contribute better content. In the area of sustainability, its use is not well documented. To contribute to the use of persuasive technologies in sustainability, this paper carries out a literature review of published articles in the area in the past five years and summarizes the main findings based on three main themes: the design and development of the technology to make it adaptive to users, the evaluation of the technology, and the findings from the evaluation. Our results suggest that most persuasive technologies are developed as mobile applications, IoT devices or serious games and the most common behaviour change targeted by the persuasive technologies in this domain are energy conservation and sustainable food management. The most common persuasive strategies that are used are rewards, suggestions and self-monitoring. In terms of evaluation, a self-reported evaluation method was applied by most authors. While the range of evaluation of the developed persuasive technologies was between one hour and one year, the number of recruited participants ranged from two to over nine hundred. The findings from the evaluation were mostly mixed with several authors reporting positive results (behaviour change) for some participants. Based on these results, we suggest considerations for the development of future persuasive technologies for sustainability. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The need for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is felt across “agriculture food supply chain (AFSC)” to tackle the global demand for food items and concerns regarding food safety and security. Further, this transformation is possible due to recent advancements in I4.0 technologies, including “Internet-of-Things (IoT), Blockchain, Big Data (BD), Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Cloud Computing (CC) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS)” etc. Each of these technologies has a specific role in making the AFSC eco-system smart enough to address today's world challenges. Thus, this paper reviews these major technologies in AFSC to understand their applications and recent trends. The review is based on 146 articles from the “Scopus and Web of Science” database. The articles include peer-reviewed journals published between 2010 and 2020. The applications of reviewed technology in AFSC are analysed under five research dimensions, namely traceability and food safety, information system management, food waste, control and monitoring, decision making and agribusiness, and other miscellaneous-based applications. The study suggests that the integration of reviewed technologies can be more useful to provide low-cost solutions and empower sustainability in AFSC. Further, blockchain can emerge as a game-changer to ensure food safety and security. The current challenges and future research agenda in concerned themes are also identified to further motivate researchers to develop this area. This is the first paper that summarises the recent developments of six technologies for AFSC research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of ubiquitous computing and mobile technologies, mobile apps are tailored to support users to perform target behaviors in various domains, including a sustainable future. This article provides a systematic evaluation of mobile apps for sustainable waste management to deconstruct and compare the persuasive strategies employed and their implementations. Specifically, it targeted apps that support various sustainable waste management activities such as personal tracking, recycling, conference management, data collection, food waste management, do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, games, etc. The authors who are persuasive technology researchers retrieved a total of 244 apps from App Store and Google Play, out of which 148 apps were evaluated. Two researchers independently analyzed and coded the apps and a third researcher was involved to resolve any disagreement. They coded the apps based on the persuasive strategies of the persuasive system design framework. Overall, the findings uncover that out of the 148 sustainable waste management apps evaluated, primary task support was the most employed category by 89% (n = 131) apps, followed by system credibility support implemented by 76% (n = 112) apps. The dialogue support was implemented by 71% (n = 105) apps and social support was the least utilized strategy by 34% (n = 51) apps. Specifically, Reduction (n = 97), personalization (n = 90), real-world feel (n = 83), surface credibility (n = 83), reminder (n = 73), and self-monitoring (n = 50) were the most commonly employed persuasive strategies. The findings established that there is a significant association between the number of persuasive strategies employed and the apps’ effectiveness as indicated by user ratings of the apps. How the apps are implemented differs depending on the kind of sustainable waste management activities it was developed for. Based on the findings, this paper offers design implications for personalizing sustainable waste management apps to improve their persuasiveness and effectiveness.

	abstract = {Reducing food waste is a priority for all sectors of society as it threatens national food security and the sustainability of global agriculture. Many studies on food waste have focused on a single subject, and the psychological factors of consumer waste are often overlooked. Based on evolutionary game theory, this paper introduces consumers’ normative illusion, constructs an evolutionary game model in which the government, caterers and consumers collaborate to reduce food waste, and simulates and analyses the behavioural strategies of the three stakeholders. The results show that: Firstly, food waste can be reduced under certain conditions by incentive-guided and punishment-inhibited policies. Moreover, incentive-guided policies can reduce government expenditures more than punishment-inhibited ones. Secondly, implementation of prior intervention, the resultant intervention and reducing the probability of consumers’ aversion to the intervention of caterers can optimise the government’s punishment-inhibited policy. Finally, under the punishment-inhibited policy, caterers can bear 60% of the prior intervention costs for food waste management. When caterers invest 40–60% of the prior intervention costs, both caterers and consumers can achieve the ideal state of cooperation; caterers can accept 40% of the resultant intervention cost for food waste management, and when the resultant intervention cost is less than 40%, consumers choose not to waste. Both caterers and consumers are involved in reducing food waste when the probability of consumer dissatisfaction with a caterer’s intervention is reduced to less than 40%. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, several digital tools have been designed to provide consumers with nutritional and environmental impact information about their food choices post-consumption. Many of these tools lack behavioral change modules, have low user engagement, and ignore inherent environmental nutrition trade-offs to stimulate dietary change. This study presents the design and development of a decision support system to enhance consumer health while meeting sustainability goals from a pre-consumption perspective. The proposed decision support system, Dashboard for Improving Sustainable Healthy (DISH) food choices, employs behavioral features, traffic light labels, and nudges to inform end-users about the nutritional health performance and environmental impact of meals. DISH uses a simple metric that allows end-users to explore the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained or lost from consuming 100 kcal of a meal. The metric combines the positive or negative nutritional health effects (μ-DALYs) of consuming a meal and environmental damage (endpoint impact expressed in DALYs) on human health. In the DISH application, end-users are rewarded or deducted EnCoins, which represent the number of silver or gold coins lost or gained based on the cost ($) of environmental damage (midpoint impacts) of a meal compared to reference sustainable healthy and unsustainable and unhealthy meal. DISH's gamification module enables end-users to track the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained/lost and gold or silver rewards or deductions from consuming 100 kcal of a selected meal through cumulative minutes gained or lost and EnCoins. In promoting a sustainable diet culture, the gamification module enables users to create groups and communities where friends and families can track their sustainability performance through meal decisions. The DISH application is currently available online and can be accessed by an end-user through any device. Further pilot studies will focus on testing the technology in partner campus cafeterias. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Food waste is a major contributor to climate change. Schools offer a unique opportunity to educate on this issue while also reducing food waste generation; however, few climate-change education curricula that include a food waste component have been developed and tested with fidelity. Thus, the purpose of this cluster randomized controlled study was to assess the effectiveness of a climate change and food waste education program called NJ Leaves No Bite Behind (NJLNBB) among fifth-grade students. Lessons on food waste and sustainable food behaviors were developed that aligned with NJ Student Learning Standards for Climate Change and Next-Generation Science Standards. Participants (n = 162) completed pre- and post-test surveys that assessed knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behaviors. Post-test, the experimental group (n = 102) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher mean scores in knowledge, social norms, behavioral intentions, and perceived behavioral control compared to the control group (n = 60), with medium effect sizes, as determined by partial eta-squared. There were no significant between-group differences in mean score attitudes, self-efficacy, motivation to comply, or climate-friendly behaviors post-test. Almost three-quarters of participants who received the program agreed or strongly agreed the lessons were fun (75.5%), liked the card games (72.5), and learned a lot (78.4%). These findings are promising in terms of teaching adolescents the impacts of food waste on the climate. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: The objective of this meta-narrative review was to identify, organise and map the literature on food provision and nutrition support at the summer and winter Olympic and Paralympic Games (OPG) and similar major competition events over the past 21 years. This builds on a comprehensive update of a previous historical review of the evolution of food provision at the summer Olympic Games up until 2000 and considers contemporary issues such as the global pandemic and sustainability goals. Methods: A range of sources included primary research and review articles, edited book chapters, theses, conference papers or abstracts, International Olympic Committee reports, Organising Committees’ food vision and post-Games reports, independent professional reports, and media and periodicals including magazines and trade journals. The search strategy included four steps: a database search that complied with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews criteria, a search of the Olympic Studies Centre, a review of reference lists for unpublished sources, and a Google search for additional media reports. The researchers followed an iterative process where emerging narratives were discussed, recorded and refined as data were extracted. Results: The data from 229 records were extracted into a spreadsheet and grouped according to the type of evidence and specific event, then presented chronologically to give a perspective on the development of food provision and nutrition support. Eleven narratives emerged from the data extraction: ‘description of meals, menus and food’, ‘vision of the food provision’, ‘food safety’, ‘catering company involvement’, ‘sponsorship or contracts with food companies’, ‘athlete perspective’, ‘stakeholder perspective’, ‘athlete food intake,’ ‘nutrition input in food provision’, ‘food environment’ and ‘sustainability’. Conclusion: Results suggest that athletes' dining expectations, organising committee budgets, expert input and current global trends have led to food delivery changes. The OPG food environment has the capacity to positively influence the dietary choices of athletes and teams, while evolving to meet contemporary global challenges such as COVID-19 and sustainability targets. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Collegiate sporting venues have been leading efforts toward zero-waste events in pursuit of more sustainable operations. This study audited the landfill-destined waste generated at the University of Missouri (MU) football stadium in 2014 and evaluated the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy use associated with waste management options, including options that do and do not comply with zero-waste definitions. An estimated 47.3 metric tons (mt) of waste was generated, the majority (29.6 mt waste) came from off-site, pre-game food preparation activities; of which over 96 percent (%) was pre-consumer and un-sold food waste. The remaining 17.7 mt originated from inside the stadium; recyclable materials accounting for 43%, followed by food waste, 24%. Eleven waste management strategies were evaluated using theWaste Reduction Model (WARM). Results indicate that scenarios achieving zero waste compliance are not necessarily the most effective means of reducing GHG emissions or energy use. The two most effective approaches are eliminating edible food waste and recycling. Source reduction of edible food reduced GHGs by 103.1 mt (carbon dioxide equivalents) CO2e and generated energy savings of 448.5 GJ compared to the baseline. Perfect recycling would result in a reduction of 25.4 mt CO2e and 243.7 GJ compared to the baseline. The primary challenges to achieving these reductions are the difficulties of predicting demand for food and influencing consumer behavior. © 2017 by the authors.},

One approach to reducing household food waste is through education campaigns. We recruited 501 households divided into three types of intervention groups and compared with a control group to better understand the efficacy of diverse education campaign approaches. Food waste interventions included a passive approach (handouts), a community engagement approach, and a gamification approach. We conducted waste audits, household surveys (pre-and post-intervention), and a focus group at the end of the campaign. The passive and gamification groups had similarly high levels of participation, while participation in the community group was very low. The passive group and the gamification group had higher self-reported awareness of food wasting after the campaign and lower food wastage than the control group. Waste audits found marginally significant differences between the game group and the control (p = 0.07) and no difference between the other campaign groups and the control group in edible food wasted. Frequent gamers were found to generate less edible food waste than infrequent gamers. We conclude that the evidence about the potential for gamification as an effective education change tool is promising and we recommend further study. © 2020 by the authors.

To understand such roles, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 9 vegans. Our findings highlight an intensive use of (digital) media, especially in the early phase of changing consumption practices. Instead of gamification or persuasive design, media triggers initial irritation, provides information to develop a vegan-specific consumption knowledge and connects like-minded people. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

	abstract = {Product expirations at retail stores erode profits and burden the environment. We investigate whether manufacturers can leverage salesforce compensation design as a waste-reduction tool. We propose a data-driven framework that uses structural econometric modeling and agency theory. Our analysis starts with a game theoretic model in which a salesperson interacts with a manufacturer that reimburses retailers and penalizes its own salesforce for expired products. We then use our model’s equilibrium outcome to estimate factors that determine the effort exerted by the sales representatives of a consumer-packaged-goods manufacturer. We first show theoretically that a manufacturer can simultaneously increase profits and reduce waste by increasing its sales representatives’ penalty for product expiration that occurs at the retailer. Based on this, we formulate a manufacturer’s profit maximization problem to compute optimum expiration penalties. Solving this problem for the manufacturer, we find the potential to simultaneously reduce waste and improve profits for 14% of the product–market combinations in our dataset. For these cases, we find that charging the salesperson 2.1 times the commission (on average) for each expired unit can increase the manufacturer’s profits by 0.58% and reduce waste by 23.3%. This study determines that a profit-seeking manufacturer can reduce waste at retailers by optimizing its salesforce incentive structure. Our work bridges the salesforce compensation and sustainable operations literatures. Furthermore, our framework allows consumer-packaged-goods manufacturers to identify win-win opportunities for the environment and their bottom line. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society},

	abstract = {Nowadays, food wastage and childhood obesity are major issues. They are not only related to published health and economic matters but are also associated with the exhaustion of the environment and available natural resources. Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Globally, in 2016 the number of overweight children under the age of five was estimated to be over 41 million. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. In this context, the Green Deal and the “Farm to Fork” strategies introduced by the European Commission in 2020 support actions that can reduce food waste and change eating behavior to achieve a more sustainable society. One way to make children more aware of the environment and induce them to eat healthier food in the future is the introduction of educational games made by food waste through which they learn the importance of the environment and the health impact of the food they eat. This chapter describes an example of a food product designed for children, which, in the future, might help them to experience something educational and fun while taking care of a plant and watching it grow. It is also an opportunity to teach them to respect and care about the environment and follow a sustainable healthy diet when adults. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Food waste can meet diverse demand if treated harmlessly while may bring severe environmental problems if managed improperly. China is currently trying to facilitate food waste harmless disposal and resource utilization by urban food waste management. However, conflicts of interest among government departments, restaurants and waste disposal companies often make it difficult to achieve effective urban food waste management. This paper conducts a theoretical modeling and simulation analysis of behavioral strategy interaction of the above three participants by a combination of evolutionary game and system dynamics approach. To avoid opportunistic behaviors and regulation inefficiency that occurred in fixed penalty scheme (F-scheme), we introduce random inspection penalty scheme (R-scheme) to the tripartite evolutionary game in urban food waste management. Then an in-depth scenario analysis under F-scheme and R-scheme is carried out to investigate the influences of key variables on strategy evolution of participants. The results indicate that, compared with F-scheme, R-scheme contributes to both system stability promotion and practicality enhancement. Food waste treatment fee and regulation cost are influencing factors that respectively affect the strategic choices of restaurants and government departments. To a certain extent, exposure probability that represents informal regulation of the public and NGO can improve urban food waste management. Therefore, it is critical for government departments to adopt R-scheme, take advantage of the informal regulation of the public and NGO, gradually reduce food waste treatment fee and maintain a reasonable regulation cost to improve urban food waste management, thereby promoting food waste harmless disposal and resource utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

To best understand the challenges in handling of fresh fruits and vegetables, it helps to trace those items in the home back through retail outlets, food service providers, distribution centers, transport, packing, harvest, and production practices. Unlike a supply chain which seeks to optimize efficiency between harvest and market, a value chain seeks to deliver high-quality product to the market. Of increasing interest in the management of postharvest chains is sustainability of produce from farm to market and reduction of food waste. Challenges in handling within a value chain include marketing equitably, handling items in stores, ensuring food safety, developing quality management plans, coping with constrained handling, minimizing physiological stress, and understanding transitions at purchase and harvest. Management programs must include an understanding of product flow from farm to home as well as money flow back through the chain. Simulation models (games) have been developed to better understand these flows and how to improve postharvest handling of fresh produce using systems-thinking practices. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

These imbalances and vulnerabilities are particularly strong in cities, where most of the global population lives and that are at the core of the major challenges linked with food production and consumption. The food system transition needs cities as key game-changers towards more sustainable, equitable, healthier and fairer food systems. Against this backdrop, the present article analyses the role of food policies within urban policies, with a focus on Italian cities. In particular, the article discusses data collected from representatives of 100 municipalities across Northern, Central and Southern Italy. Moreover, it addresses the types of policies and initiatives adopted at the local level, the main obstacles encountered, the role of national and international city networks and the impact of Covid-19 on urban food security, with the aim to identify potential models of urban food policies as a structural component of a broader urban agenda. By doing this, the article aims at filling a research gap in current literature, as it is the first large-scale survey on urban food policies in Italy, identifying models of urban food policies that are already being developed within broader urban development agendas. © 2023},

	abstract = {The beer distribution game is a role-playing board game that also helps people learn about the importance of supply chain management. However, the game does not include the major difficulties in managing food and beverages supply chains. Food and beverages are assigned expiration or best-before date. If these goods cannot be sold within the period of the expiration or best-before date, they are wasted. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to extend the beer distribution game for incorporating these issues and to investigate the effects of the issues with playing the refined game. So, we set a time limit for products in the beer distribution game and include a rule that the products will be considered wasted after the time limit. We subsequently examined the effect of the time limit on food supply chain management. As a result of a preliminary game experiment, we find that the back order is highest at the distributors. Stock is the largest at the factory. Wholesalers and factories cause excessive waste. If the expiration date has passed, delivery is not possible, and the items will therefore be wasted. Furthermore, items will not reach the end consumer. In addition, higher inventory and waste are generated upstream. This result reflects the actual situation in the real world food and beverage industry. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The accurate operation of a Food Supply Chain (FSC) is a critical issue as it directly interfaces with health and safety matters. This study addresses coordination and conflict management in a three-level FSC that embraces a new inventory type known as growing items like poultry and livestock. The chain involves a rearing farm as the supplier, a processed food producer as the manufacturer, and multiple processed food retailers. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is applied by the manufacturer to handle the retailers' systems and prevent replenishment mismatches and thereby food waste. To increase its market coverage, the manufacturer needs to provide the retailers with enough incentives to enter this setting. So, a cost-sharing contract is designed under which the manufacturer undertakes a fraction of the retailers’ holding costs. Accordingly, the manufacturer faces two contradictory targets, increasing its market coverage by convincing the retailers to enter the system on the one hand and managing its costs efficiently on the other hand. An analytic solution approach with a game-theoretic perspective is developed to solve the model. Extensive numerical experiments and a case study are provided, presenting fruitful managerial insights that can be utilized by the policymakers and chain members under different settings. The results highlight the efficiency of our VMI and cost-sharing collaboration scheme in enhancing the performance of the chain. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the ever-growing popularity of food deliver, more and more consumers are embracing this convenience as part of their lifestyle. However, the issue of food waste created by the food deliver industry has become a pressing concern in society. This paper aims to examine the link between food waste and food delivery services, and investigate the effects of anti-food waste regulations on the generation of food waste and the choice of logistics strategies in an Online-to-Offline (O2O) supply chain. Using game-theoretical approach, we focus on two prominent logistics strategies—the restaurant-free self-logistics strategy (RF strategy) and the platform-charge logistics strategy (PC strategy). Our research results show that anti-food waste regulation can effectively reduce food waste in food delivery service under the PC logistics strategy. The choice of logistics strategy is constrained by the online market potential, the relative logistics costs of platform logistics, and anti-food waste regulations. If the anti-food waste regulation is strict, as long as the size of the food delivery market and the relative logistics costs of platform logistics are not simultaneously small, the RF strategy will be the equilibrium strategy, whereas the supply chain members should choose the PC strategy. The study thus offers useful inferences for theory and practice. Copyright © 2024 Xu, Du and Xu.},

The food service industry is unable to operate normally and faces issues such as frequent leave requests, shortened business hours and reduction in the number of seats in restaurants to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, several restaurants have been forced to close. Therefore, this study proposes a game system that applies the mechanism of the prediction market to solicit ideas from employees for recovery of sales in small restaurants and effective use of ingredients (including reduction of food waste) under the business scenario in COVID-19. In such a game, routine restaurant operations can be understood, current issues can be analyzed and the deductions from these can be used as a reference for subsequent business opportunities. The game will improve communication between owners and employees. Understanding the contents of food waste will be beneficial to employees and consumers. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Food waste is currently a major challenge for the world. It is the precursor to several socioeconomic problems that are plaguing modern society. To counter and to, simultaneously, stand by the undernourished, surplus food redistribution has surfaced as a viable solution. Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-mediated food redistribution is a highly scalable approach and it percolates into the lives of the masses far better. Even if ICT is not brought into the picture, the presence of food surplus redistribution in developing countries such as India is scarce and is limited to only a few of the major cities. The discussion of a surplus food redistribution framework under strategic settings is a less discussed topic around the globe. This paper aims to address a surplus food redistribution framework under strategic settings, thereby facilitating a smoother exchange of surplus food in the smart cities of developing countries and beyond. As ICT is seamlessly available in smart cities, the paper aims to focus the framework in these cities. However, this can be extended beyond the smart cities to places with greater human involvement. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Consumers can make a difference depending on their eating behaviour and conscientiousness about minimizing environmental damage. One way to make children more aware of the environment and induce them to eat healthier food in the future might be educational games where they could learn the importance of the environment and the effect of the food they eat on their health status. In this study, we investigated parental behaviour when feeding their children and their willingness to pay for a game product with educational and eating functions. The sample consisted of 300 parents of children aged from 4 to 12. A hypothetical choice experiment has been used and a latent class model estimated the parents’ preferences for a plant‐based product game carrying two attributes, namely, the price and narrative context of the game The results indicated that parents were willing to pay more for a product with a storybook related to healthy eating habits or recycling than one with no storybook. Moreover, two dominant feeding styles in households were found: indulgent parents and uninvolved parents. This alternative approach is oriented toward educating people from the early stages of their lives, creating a favourable environment for the development of preferences for healthier food. © 2021 by the authors.

To create an experience that could be playful enough to attract and engage people, while still subtly conveying a serious message, we chose the game of hopscotch as a backdrop for a playful experience, revealing at each step the journey a plastic bottle goes through during its lifecycle. Accordingly, we named the work Rayuela, which is the Spanish word for hopscotch. We built Rayuela as a modular system consisting of 11 light boxes, each telling a different fact about the plastic bottle's journey. Each time people jumped on a box, it turned the next one on, thus progressively revealing the story. As the work was designed for exhibition in a very large public festival lasting about a month, design considerations ranged form aesthetic and interactive aspects to robustness and reliability. In this paper, we describe the conceptual rationale for Rayuela, its design and building process, and the methods for automated data gathering we implemented. We then present the results of the field study, and discuss preliminary findings, as well as implications for future design. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Planet Earth is under severe stress from several inter-linked factors mainly associated with rising global population, linear resource consumption, security of resources, unsurmountable waste generation, and social inequality, which unabated will lead to an unsustainable 21st Century. The traditional way products are designed promotes a linear economy that discards recoverable resources and creates negative environmental and social impacts. Here, we suggest multi-disciplinary approaches encompassing chemistry, process engineering and sustainability science, and sustainable solutions in "game changer" challenges in three intersecting arenas of food: Sustainable diet, valorisation of unavoidable food supply chain wastes, and circularity of food value chain systems aligning with the United Nations' seventeen Sustainable Development Goals. In the arena of sustainable diet, comprehensive life cycle assessment using the global life cycle inventory datasets and recommended daily servings is conducted to rank food choices, covering all food groups from fresh fruits/vegetables, lentils/pulses and grains to livestock, with regard to health and the environment, to emphasise the essence of plant-based diet, especially plant-based sources of protein, for holistic systemic sustainability and stability of the earth system. In the arena of unavoidable food supply chain wastes, economically feasible and synergistically (energy and material) integrated innovative biorefinery systems are suggested to transform unavoidable food waste into functional and platform chemical productions alongside energy vectors: Fuel or combined heat and power generation. In the arena of circularity of food value chain systems, novel materials and methods for plant-based protein functionalisation for food/nutraceutical applications are investigated using regenerative bio-surfactants from unavoidable food waste. This circular economy or industrial symbiosis example thus combines the other two arenas, i.e., plant-based protein sourcing and unavoidable food waste valorisation. The multi-disciplinary analysis here will eventually impact on policies for dietary change, but also contribute knowledge needed by industry and policy makers and raise awareness amongst the population at large for making a better approach to the circular economy of food. © 2020 by the authors.},

Using the proposed method, the calculation time for a game that models an auction of products was reduced by 46%. Additionally, the effects of the selling time limit for manufacturers and supermarkets, one of the business practices, on the food (milk) supply chain were examined.

However, blockchain adoption requires the participation of all supply chain members (e.g. suppliers and logistics service providers) while their incentives remain unclear. Considering a multi-tier system comprising a supplier, a retailer and a logistic service provider, we solve a multi-stage optimisation problem when the products stored in advance are subject to shelf-life due date risk while the real-time order is subject to upstream responsive pricing threat. We evaluate the effectiveness of product tracking system based on blockchain applications. Both real-data validation and game theoretic analysis reveal the stakeholder’s participation incentive conflicts and the dark side of triple-marginalization. However, a sequential co-opetition mechanism is capable of coordinating the stakeholders’ preferences for the product tracking system. We further find that saving waste and balancing the advanced and real-time orders do not necessarily indicate improvement of environmental sustainability. We suggest that: Retailers should carefully judge the product tracking system because of the potential lose-lose situation for profitability and sustainability. But once retailers can profit from blockchain adoption, suppliers are likely to profit from joining the blockchain. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Backyard poultry producers have been associated with outbreaks of exotic (e.g. avian influenza) and endemic (e.g. Salmonella) disease all over the world. Currently in the UK the registration of small flocks (less than 50 birds) with local authorities is voluntary therefore there is not an accurate record of how many keepers and birds there are or where they are located. This lack of information (e.g. how many birds they keep, what type of birds, biosecurity measures they implement, etc.) may compromise contingency planning in an outbreak. A questionnaire was designed and implemented to gather information that will allow some of the knowledge gaps to be filled. The questionnaire comprised a total of 63 questions divided into seven sections (characterisation of the keeper, location of the enterprise and interest in poultry, poultry husbandry, transport of poultry, details about the poultry enterprise, marketing of poultry products, and poultry health/biosecurity). The questionnaire was implemented through an online survey, which was promoted through web links in smallholders’ websites, Facebook pages, the SRUC network, a course about poultry welfare, and leaflets at smallholders’ festivals. The survey was open from 24th October 2016 to 10th April 2017 and 176 questionnaires were completed by target respondents. Overall, our results suggest that the level of disease identified by backyard poultry keepers is low but the majority of the backyard poultry keepers also keep other livestock species, with an associated increased risk for disease transmission between species. Almost all respondents reported implementing at least one biosecurity measure, although in the majority of cases the measures taken were not comprehensive. A lack of knowledge about the legislation concerning poultry-keeping activities was evidenced by the answers given to some questions, such as the feeding of kitchen scraps and how to dispose of dead stocks. This investigation fills gaps in knowledge which will allow industry stakeholders and policy makers to adapt their current disease programmes and contingency plans to the reality of the health and biosecurity status of backyard poultry. It also highlights that government could play a more active role in engaging with backyard poultry keepers and in finding ways to disseminate reliable information generally and about disease outbreaks specifically, to these keepers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

This study explored food systems as an alternative pedagogical approach to engage students in nutrition education. METHODS: After playing a food systems computer game, 250 13- to 16-year-old students in 5 Western Australian secondary schools, participated in group discussions to distinguish learning and interests in food systems. Discussion records were thematically coded using constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Students reported crop growth, food production and food waste, healthier food choices, and food systems as knowledge outcomes of game play. They requested additional content on food production, costing, handling, processing, and accessing local produce. Experiential activities were preferred pedagogical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-curricular pedagogy which embraces human and planetary health through a food systems lens, can engage adolescents in nutrition education.

	abstract = {Insect-based food and feed have received a lot of attention recently. The EU Farm-to-Fork Strategy, for example, mentions insects as an alternative feed material that could reduce the environmental and climate impact of livestock production. Insects are an interesting source of feed because of their ability to convert many types of organic material into protein and fat, including food products that currently go to waste. Having an insect industry producing protein meal from recycled food waste would contribute towards more sustainable agricultural and aquaculture sectors. However, there are many questions associated with this development which we cannot answer at this point. For instance, how much food waste is actually available at the European and global levels for insect-based protein meal production? If we used the available food waste for insect meal production, what would be the consequences for the agricultural markets and how would it affect the agricultural GHG emission budget? In this article we show that there is a considerable amount of food waste that could be used for insect meal production; which would have substantial impacts on agricultural markets – particularly in the case where there was some relaxation of regulations. According to our calculations, agricultural greenhouse gas emissions would only be modestly affected. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The local environment can be explored to sustain effective sustainability learning. With this aim, new learning methodologies can be fostered, namely mobile and game-based learning, as is the case of the EduPARK app. This app supports innovative learning strategies through treasure hunt games, integrating multimedia and augmented reality resources, in natural spaces. This paper presents a pilot case study of a pedagogical approach based on the exploration of a game in the EduPARK app, in the outdoors. The game was developed to be explored in the largest annual event of the University of Aveiro (UA) – XPERiMENTA 2022 – where students of several ages and the wider community are invited to participate in diverse activities on the campuses. The main goal of the activity “XPERiMENTA with EduPARK in the UA Campus” was to raise basic education students’ awareness towards nature conservation. Eighteen students (14 and 15 years-old) explored an interdisciplinary educational game that encouraged them to follow a path through the UA Campuses to promote learning related to recycling, renewable energies, food waste, and ocean plastic pollution. Simultaneously, curricular contents of Science, Mathematics, Education for Citizenship, and cultural aspects of the city of Aveiro were articulated. At the end of the activity, an individual and anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the activity was applied. Students revealed a positive attitude towards the EduPARK app, as their answers revealed they felt motivated to learn during the game. Additionally, students reached a good performance in the game, although difficulties in one specific question were identified. This paper presents preliminary results that will inform the development of a new related project, the EduCITY, that aims to promote education for sustainability through a smart learning city environment. © 2023 Proceedings of the International Conferences on e-Society 2023, ES 2023 and Mobile Learning 2023, ML 2023.

	abstract = {Food waste is one of the greatest economic and ethical challenges in the world. Empowering consumers with the ability to assess the quality of fruit can be a game changer for reducing waste and motivating a healthier diet. In this paper, we present Meta-Sticker a novel low-cost non-invasive solution for accurate fruit sensing via a sub-THz metamaterial sticker. The key idea is to exploit fruit as a substrate for resonating meta-atoms. Changes in the chemical composite of the fruit over time (e.g., sugar and water concentration) yield variation in the dielectric properties of the fruit (here substrate). Interestingly, this would affect the resonant frequency of the Meta-Sticker. We design Meta-Sticker to resonate in the sub-THz bands for their sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the inner pulp of the fruit. We develop a model that translates the resonance of Meta-Sticker to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We fabricate Meta-Sticker on paper and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments. We demonstrate that our system can estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruits with an average Normalized RMSE value of 1.24%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceptible by the consumer. Our design is non-invasive, low-cost (less than a cent), passive, biodegradable, and conformal. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {Consumers are responsible for almost 50 percent of food waste. Consumer-focused interventions are crucial to achieve many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 12.3. There are many factors that cause food waste, and these can be prevented by changing the consumption behavior of adults. Mobile apps are seen as promising tools to change consumer behavior for ensuring more sustainable food consumption. This study describes the development process and examines the perceived quality of MySusCof, an app intended to reduce the food waste of consumers. The uMARS scale was used for collecting data from consumers. Within the scope of the study, two studies were conducted to examine the development process of the application and to determine the user reactions to the mobile application. Results show that gamification elements with hedonic and social components, as well as functional aspects, are important features for user engagement and perceived impact. The qualitative results also supported the user experience in both hedonic and functional value and role of mobile apps to lead behavior change. This study serves as a guideline for future developers of mobile apps intended to lead consumers to a more sustainable food consumption. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Consumer food waste in industrialised countries is becoming an increasing concern as its impact on greenhouse emissions is comparable to that of the aviation industry. In recent years we have accordingly seen a growing interest in HCI to support users getting into more sustainable consumption practices. As part of this movement, we present in this paper a serious game called Face-The-Waste that is meant to increase users food literacy and educate them about the impact and development of food waste. Our serious game comes in the form of a public installation that uses provocative design to engage the users. They had to answer multiple choice questions and if they answered wrongly real food would be disposed into a bin in front of the users eyes. The aim with this was to create a strong emotional response and increase the level of reflection on the topic. In our evaluation we not only found that the users often voiced very strong emotional reactions but also engaged and discussed the question and their content. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such provocations can add a new layer for the design of serious games.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Contextual factors may have a strong impact on food perception and liking, especially when children are involved in behavioral, sensory, and consumer testing. In this chapter, we report and critically discuss the findings from earlier and recent studies dealing with food context and its effect on children's (age 3-18years) food perception, liking, and selection, with a specific and in-depth analysis of the following factors: the meal (i.e., portion and container size, food variety, appropriateness of eating occasion); the physical environment (i.e., laboratory vs. realistic settings); and the social environment (i.e., social influence and modeling). Attention is also devoted to the analysis of age- and gender-related differences in the effect of contextual factors on children's eating behavior. Studying the contextual factors related to food consumption among children could provide a deeper understanding of their thoughts and expectations about food and food settings, and could help in finding solutions to increase the acceptance of target products (e.g., fruits and vegetables), thus contributing to improvement of children's health, and to reducing food waste, which is a critical issue, especially in institutional contexts, such as school. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Dogs (Canis familiaris) are ubiquitous in human settlements. A range of studies suggests that uses of dogs vary with ecological context. High seasonality and reliance upon large game appears to favor investments in the uses of dogs as aids in hunting and hauling. Regional cultural traditions may also play significant roles in attitudes and behaviors towards dogs. We use ethnographic and archaeological data to assess six hypotheses concerning the roles of dogs in the traditional villages on the Mid-Fraser Canyon in British Columbia. We find that it is likely that village dogs lived in traditional Mid-Fraser villages where they may have consumed human food waste, but were also used for hunting, possibly hauling loads, as a source of products, and as a target of ritual treatments. Given their importance in numerous activities, dogs may have been wealth items for select households. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Worldwide, childhood obesity puts children at risk for co-morbidities and early death. Despite innovative interventions to enhance healthy nutritional choices, effective, sustainable outcomes are lacking, and unhealthy behaviors persist. Gamification shows promise in increasing child engagement, motivation and learning, while minimizing teacher burden. With child input, we designed an interactive digital game focused on basic nutrition knowledge for children to foster healthy nutrition choices. Our purpose is to describe the process, challenges, and lessons learned while designing MountainQuest, a multi-level, action/adventure, digital game engaging school-age children in decision-making through a game narrative incorporating mechanics. Method: Four design, implementation, and playtesting/user iterations were completed to assure acceptability, feasibility, and rigor of MountainQuest: 0.0) preliminary design; 1.0) initial prototyping with 2D platformer; 2.0) 3D platformer; and 3.0) 3D redesign. At least five SA children (8-14 years old) played each version for 3-5 days and provided feedback through semi-structured interviews. Affinity diagram analysis was used and informed each iteration. Inter-rater agreement on common themes was ≥ 70%. Results: Common themes were mapped into two prioritized lists: issues/bugs and game features wish list. For iteration 0.0, children collaborated with the research team to develop the game narrative and characters. Iteration 1.0 was evaluated as too “simplistic,” “short,” preachy,” and “cartoonish.” Iteration 2.0 had scenes deemed too long with difficult mechanics, and disruptive food management scenes; suggestions included incorporating more exploration and mazes. Iteration 3.0 yielded a game where school-age children manage food inventories influencing hunger, thirst, and energy metrics to successfully navigate a mountain, defeat trolls, and save a village. Conclusion: The children's input was direct, precise, and challenged the game designers. Inclusion of children as direct informants guided the development of MountainQuest into an engaging, interactive, and educational game to enhance healthy nutritional choices, preparing it for an experimental trial. © The Authors, 2021.

	abstract = {Black products constitute about 15% of the domestic plastic waste stream, of which the majority is single-use packaging and trays for food. This material is not, however, readily recycled owing to the low sensitivity of black pigments to near infrared radiation used in conventional plastic sorting facilities. Accordingly, there is mounting evidence that the demand for black plastics in consumer products is partly met by sourcing material from the plastic housings of end-of-life waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE). Inefficiently sorted WEEE plastic has the potential to introduce restricted and hazardous substances into the recyclate, including brominated flame retardants (BFRs), Sb, a flame retardant synergist, and the heavy metals, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb. The current paper examines the life cycles of single-use black food packaging and black plastic WEEE in the context of current international regulations and directives and best practices for sorting, disposal and recycling. The discussion is supported by published and unpublished measurements of restricted substances (including Br as a proxy for BFRs) in food packaging, EEE plastic goods and non-EEE plastic products. Specifically, measurements confirm the linear economy of plastic food packaging and demonstrate a complex quasi-circular economy for WEEE plastic that results in significant and widespread contamination of black consumer goods ranging from thermos cups and cutlery to tool handles and grips, and from toys and games to spectacle frames and jewellery. The environmental impacts and human exposure routes arising from WEEE plastic recycling and contamination of consumer goods are described, including those associated with marine pollution. Regarding the latter, a compilation of elemental data on black plastic litter collected from beaches of southwest England reveals a similar chemical signature to that of contaminated consumer goods and blended plastic WEEE recyclate, exemplifying the pervasiveness of the problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},
