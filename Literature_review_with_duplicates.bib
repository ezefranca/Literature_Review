  abstract  = {The fields of Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction have traditionally evolved in parallel, with little cross-pollination, both in industry and academia. However, effectively delivering software products offering superior user experiences requires a tight collaboration between professionals from both fields. In recent years, some approaches combining the two perspectives have been proposed in industry, including dual-track agile software development. Yet, very few courses cover those integrated approaches in academia, and it appears that no publication so far has reported the existence of a scholarly course covering dual-track agile. This paper introduces a course that addresses the divide between Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction through an integrated approach to requirements engineering and interaction design, in the context of dual-track agile. The course design combines traditional and flipped-classroom delivery, together with project-based learning. During the course project, students learn to design and implement software systems that address real problems and satisfy real stakeholders' needs by being useful, usable, and enjoyable to use. This paper documents the author's experience designing and teaching the course over the past four years. It aims to convince, inspire, and enable others to teach similar courses, bringing interaction design to the forefront of agile software development.},

In a post-phenomenological understanding, things and us are interdependent in that they mutually shape each other. And as a whole, technology or designed things mediate the relations between our world and us. This can be a challenge for designers. Through the making of design videos, we explored narrative strategies for creating stories featuring technological mediation. These include humanness, patterns in time, and non-human ensembles. We reflect on how the videos at different stages of the design process have helped to a) speculate on technological mediated relationships, b) synthesize and reflect on qualitative data on technological mediation and c) anticipate technological mediation. The paper contributes different narrative strategies for design videos and the role these videos can play within a design process aimed at elaborating the mediated qualities of technologies.},

In this study, we discuss the development of an educational chatbot game 'CiboPoli', that's specialised in teaching children about healthy lifestyle through an interactive social game environment. The presented game is based on a paper prototype that we developed to teach primary school students about healthy diet and food waste management. The current approach will be more engaging and pose AI capabilities. This is still a work in progress and we plan to improve its design by incorporating additional components, such as dialog management module, user-specific knowledge module or machine learning module. Future work will be devoted to integrating machine learning to automatically identify learners emotions and provide personalised suggestions. Moreover, we tested the initial prototype with school students and found that it outperforms the paper version. Future work will focus on applying it to other domains and demographics.},

We sense eating actions of players by analyzing chewing sounds captured by a low-cost microphone attached to the players cheek. Our interest in using cooperative eating as a way of interacting in virtual reality is driven by the possibilities of creating a cross-modal gameplay experience that benefits social interactions. A user study with 22 players showed that eating real food improved players feeling of presence, challenged trust dependencies and made the survival aspect of the game feel more "real". We use these insights to articulate three design themes that can guide designers in creating virtual reality games that incorporate cooperative eating. Ultimately, our work aims to guide design thinking towards using underexplored interaction methods in virtual reality games, thereby reiterating the post-digital design theme of TEI 2018.},

  abstract   = {Novices learn innovation best through project-based learning (PBL), working in face-to-face teams to tackle real-world problems. Yet, real-world projects are complex, stressful, and especially challenging for novices. Online communities could provide social support to motivate novices, but it is unclear how to design online communities to support face-to-face PBL teams. Here we ask: How might we design an online system that enlists external supporters to provide online social support to motivate PBL students? Our need-finding study found that PBL students received infrequent social support, rarely engaged in help-seeking, and perceived little progress until the end of their projects. Based on these findings, we designed CheerOn, an online social support system that prompts novice student teams to externalize progress allowing external, online supporters to offer social support. We tested CheerOn with 3 PBL teams and 15 external supporters over a 6-week course. We found that external supporters provided instrumental, informational, and emotional support that strengthened students’ bonds to the community, which increased help-seeking. Supporters also provided appraisal support, which increased students’ perceived value of their work. Supporters were more likely to offer informational and instrumental support when they were promoted or saw a clear need for help; supporters who received gratitude from students were more likely to offer emotional support in return; and supporters who were closely connected to the community were more likely to offer appraisal and instrumental support. Theoretically, this research contributes to our understanding of how hybrid face-to-face and online communities can impact the behavior of PBL students, specifically towards the facilitation of help-seeking behavior, as well as increased understanding of how different types of social support (i.e., appraisal, emotional, informational, and instrumental) can impact the participation of PBL students and supporters. Practically, this research contributes to our understanding of how to design socio-technical systems that facilitate social support for offline novice PBL students working, expanding the instructional resources available for preparing novices in PBL environments.},

Recent studies demonstrate two critical factors: Persistent stereotypes about "who does computer science" can preclude interest in the field for members of these groups; many also perceive computing as "irrelevant" and "asocial". While these issues must be addressed at multiple ages and levels, many suggest that we should start early, before students have developed stereotypes. As a step in combating (mis-)perceptions of ability and relevance, we developed and conducted a spectrum of week-long summer "code camps" for regional middle-school students. These camps emphasize meaningful uses of computing, on building self-efficacy, and on broadening understanding of who does and can do computer science. In this paper, we focus on our "data science for social good" (ds4sg) camp, in which students explored computational approaches to data science through a lens of computing for social good, discovering how computing helps them not only better understand societal issues but also convince others to address problems. We discuss the rationale for the curriculum and its content, including our uses of pair programming, personal projects, and a growth model that brings students from block-based programming to professional Jupyter data notebooks. We consider the short-term effects the camps have on students' self-efficacy and perceptions of computer science. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for those intending to offer similar camps.},

We contribute to the theoretical aspect of this research by presenting an ethnographic study on alternative farming practices, in which the farm is not so much a system but an assemblage characterized by multiple systems or rationalities always evolving and changing. In them, relationships among species alternate between mutually beneficial in one moment (or season), and harmful in the next. If HCI is to participate in and to support working with nature, we believe that it will have to situate itself within such assemblages and temporalities. In this work, we look into nontraditional users (e.g., nonhumans) and emerging forms of uses (e.g., interactions between human and other species) to help open a design space for technological interventions. We offer three ethnographic accounts in which farmers-and ourselves as researchers-learn to notice, respond, and engage in symbiotic encounters with companion species and the living soil itself.},

Despite this, we still lack an understanding of how to design effective technology-mediated nudges. In this paper we present a systematic review of the use of nudging in HCI research with the goal of laying out the design space of technology-mediated nudging - the why (i.e., which cognitive biases do nudges combat) and the how (i.e., what exact mechanisms do nudges employ to incur behavior change). All in all, we found 23 distinct mechanisms of nudging, grouped in 6 categories, and leveraging 15 different cognitive biases. We present these as a framework for technology-mediated nudging, and discuss the factors shaping nudges' effectiveness and their ethical implications.},

We have designed and conducted a technology probe that made use of simple linear predictions as a provocation, and invited people to track the life of their household essentials over a two-month period. Through a mixed-method approach we demonstrate the challenges of simple predictions, and in turn identify eight categories of contingencies that influenced prediction accuracy.

The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of this emerging field presents a challenge to scholars wishing to critically engage with prior work, identify gaps and ensure impact. It also challenges the formation of community. We present a Systematic Mapping Study of HFI research and an online data visualisation tool developed to respond to these issues. The tool allows researchers to engage in new ways with the HFI literature, propose modifications and additions to the review, and thereby actively engage in community-making. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we characterize the state of HFI, reporting trends, challenges and opportunities; (2) we provide a taxonomy and tool for diffractive reading of the literature; and (3) we offer our approach for adaptation by research fields facing similar challenges, positing value of the tool and approach beyond HFI.},

For example, HCI is exploring agency delegation and automation to support the user in managing the deluge of IoT data, make decisions, or even take actions on behalf of the user, while economic models are being proposed to drive sharing economy services. This creates new problems including how to design appropriate solutions for uncertain and dynamic human behaviour, how to ensure resources are distributed fairly, and how to ensure that the user can understand system actions and ultimately remains in control. These issues are becoming more pertinent as the IoT diversifies into safety-critical domains such as manufacturing and healthcare. This one-day workshop intends to bring together the CHI community to explore the interactional, socio-cultural, ethical, and practical challenges and approaches that these new domains raise for the IoT. With this, we want to consider how such approaches could be integrated to achieve more sustainable, inclusive, or effective interactions.},

Designers in the corporate startup realm as well as in academic HFI (Human-Food Interaction) have proposed various techno-solutions to curb complex food system issues such as malnutrition and environmental unsustainability. Quantified diet trackers, 'smart' kitchenware, food sharing apps and similar digital food technologies present opportunities for efficient food practices but also challenges to human-food relationship and social food traditions. The Parlour of Futures project reflects on these contradictions and addresses the growing trend of food-technology innovation through the lens of Speculative and Critical Design (SCD). The project takes the form of a traditional Tarot parlour where participants explore possible food-tech futures as prophecies. Through a bespoke Food Tarot cards deck presenting speculative food practices such as Monsanta[n]ism, Gut Gardening, or Turing Foodism, the project provokes playful food-tech imaginaries and future food scenarios. We discuss the opportunities of SCD in nurturing reflective food design and research, and invite OzCHI attendees to contribute their future food ideas during the Parlour demo session.},

To contribute to an understanding of "playful gustosonic experiences", we present a design and study of a novel capacitive-sensing ice cream cone, "iScream!". In a study with 32 participants, the cone played four different sounds (a roaring, crunchy, giggling, and burping sound in order to explore fantasy facilitation, food congruency, anthropomorphism and bodily response) when eating ice cream. The results are two themes derived from six findings each, which detail how players explored the different auditory interaction possibilities with their eating actions while the sounds in turn modified those eating actions. Based on these findings, we present four design tactics for designers aiming to create playful gustosonic experiences to ultimately facilitate a more playful relationship with food.},

To understand such roles, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 9 vegans. Our findings highlight an intensive use of (digital) media, especially in the early phase of changing consumption practices. Instead of gamification or persuasive design, media triggers initial irritation, provides information to develop a vegan-specific consumption knowledge and connects like-minded people.},

While mobile technology provides constant connectivity to a world outside the home, it inevitably disrupts family dynamics and the social notion of being together. In this paper, we explore "non-use" of mobile technology in a family setting. To do this, we designed the Pup-Lock provotype, a design provocation intended to challenge established expectations and practices around mobile device use at home. We report on a five-week in-depth study of using Pup-Lock with three families reflecting on their mobile device usage and their experience of non-use. Our findings illustrate how mobile use shapes social expectations and how over-use creates tensions in families. We contribute by showing how provoking non-use through design results in desirable and meaningful ways to increase family interaction. We discuss implications of designing for non-use to challenge established domestic practices around technology use.},

  abstract   = {Algorithms increasingly govern societal functions, impacting multiple stakeholders and social groups. How can we design these algorithms to balance varying interests in a moral, legitimate way? As one answer to this question, we present WeBuildAI, a collective participatory framework that enables people to build algorithmic policy for their communities. The key idea of the framework is to enable stakeholders to construct a computational model that represents their views and to have those models vote on their behalf to create algorithmic policy. As a case study, we applied this framework to a matching algorithm that operates an on-demand food donation transportation service in order to adjudicate equity and efficiency trade-offs. The service's stakeholders--donors, volunteers, recipient organizations, and nonprofit employees--used the framework to design the algorithm through a series of studies in which we researched their experiences. Our findings suggest that the framework successfully enabled participants to build models that they felt confident represented their own beliefs. Participatory algorithm design also improved both procedural fairness and the distributive outcomes of the algorithm, raised participants' algorithmic awareness, and helped identify inconsistencies in human decision-making in the governing organization. Our work demonstrates the feasibility, potential and challenges of community involvement in algorithm design.},

In this work we study two well-known strategies based on theories from the behavioral sciences, nudging and boosting, which encourage users to browse in a way that their private data are less exposed. First, an online survey (N=127) tested the comprehensibility and efficacy of various facts (boosts), before the most effective of these were evaluated against 'nudge' interventions previously shown to be efficacious in lab-studies. A three week naturalistic study (N=68) using a browser extension revealed that both nudges and boosts improve browsing privacy, as approximated by different measures.

This lack of awareness influences our food related decisions and we end up following non-sustainable food practices. To create awareness on food related issues, we present two playful dining experiences: (1) Caesar on a Skewer that presents the hidden data about water consumption levels for different foods through a Caesar salad, and (2) Chopstick Parfait that visualizes the hidden data related to the food distribution channels through the Parfait dessert. We simulated the dining environment to evaluate these dining experiences. We present findings related to both dining play interactions and edible visualizations. To guide future technological development around food related issues, we discuss the implications of our work around three themes: food arrangement, playful discomforts and delayed feedback. Through this work, we aim to advocate and inspire the use of food for designing multi-sensorial serious play.},

Within these design themes, we articulate twelve insights for interaction designers to use when working on serving data as delight.},

We conducted interviews with 12 design researchers who have worked with Probes within diverse Research through Design projects, exploring direct accounts of how and why Probes are used in practice. Our interviews brought to the fore the critical concerns behind Probe practices in relation to the language of Probing, relationships with participants, and motivations to challenge normative practices.

This criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. We join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. Based on our six-month long ethnography with the Islamic communities in a Bangladeshi city, Kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. Drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how Islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. We further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of CSCW literature in the various domains.},

Our findings show how practices, knowledge and attitudes influence the complicated process of public waste sorting. Users also displayed playfulness in their interaction and furthermore generated ideas and wishes for public waste sorting.

Research in social psychology and behavioral science suggests that social norms interventions, which convey norms shared in the community that people belong in to promote desirable behaviors, can offer a low-cost and scalable approach to encourage actions beyond the courses (ABCs). We tested three social norm interventions that presented a weekly normative message (descriptive, dynamic, or injunctive norm) with aggregate information about course participants' ABCs in the prior week. Randomized experiments in three online courses found effects on ABCs to be weak and moderated by norm message type and the complexity of the target behavior. Although the interventions did not improve course completion, the dynamic norm message was more effective at promoting ABCs for complex behaviors, such as developing environmental education activities.},

The future of work will increasingly feature human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants, where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized experiment (n = 140), we found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy, with the goal of obtaining additional training labels that can be used for fine-tuning the machine. A simulation study illustrates how even noisy labels can increase the machine’s accuracy.},

While moments of crisis expose the vulnerabilities and injustices underlying this system, this paper seeks to explore which processes and tools CSCW could purposely design to 'open up' food infrastructures and bring young and adult people in contact with different aspects of the food system to cultivate food citizenship from a more-than-human perspective. Through a collaboration with a local primary school and four different food organisations (a mushroom grower, a vegetable farm, a bread-baking community centre, and a food bank) in North East England, UK, we designed 'contact zones' that enabled a class of students aged 7 to 8 years to encounter socio-material food practices at each partnering organisation's site and in the classroom. Our insights show young people's rich engagement in the socio-materiality of place, food, and practices; how encountering food practices across very different sites helped surface the interconnectedness of the food system; and how the contact zones opened spaces to practice food citizenship. The paper offers design implications towards infrastructuring more-than-human food pedagogies. It discusses inherent power dynamics of more-than-human design collaborations, critically evaluates the role of technology in more-than-human relations, and presents three design opportunities towards a relational understanding of food.},

The participants discussed their desires and fears, such as those regarding agency, emotion recognition, voice characteristics and forms, the timing of their interactions, and voice agents’ acting on behalf of others. The dyads appreciated the flexibility in participation, their ability to send responses privately to the researchers, their access to a channel for socializing with other participants, and the opportunity to build on ideas through sequential interactions during ARC activities. In the end, we discuss how our findings might inform the design of future voice agents and present recommendations for adapting ARC method while designing with parent-teen dyads.},

The authors have partnered with a grassroots food-sharing community, FoodSharing Copenhagen (FS-CPH), to reconsider queuing practices at food-sharing events. The results present three “queuing canvases” that illustrate how FS-CPH members envision digitally mediated queuing at food-sharing events. The paper outlines three themes that emerge from this design work: communicating activism through queuing, encountering others through queuing, and transparency in queuing mechanisms. We discuss how the envisioned ideas illustrate novel perspectives on queuing in volunteer-driven settings, while sometimes falling back on accepted norms and common expectations of how queuing should work.

  abstract  = {The Living Lab concept is often distinguished from other user-centered and co-innovation approaches by an aspiration to adhere to principles of openness and empowerment of users, with a focus on innovating ideas that are realistic to the real needs of end-users. However, when it comes to implementing a living lab approach it is sometimes unclear how to put these principles into practice. In this case study, we introduce a framework for mapping three living lab principles to co-design stages within a single co-design framework and describe its use in innovating solutions for solid waste management on a university campus as a pre-cursor to scaling up the approach across the city. We present an evaluation of the framework in use against evidence of adherence to the three living lab principles of openness, empowerment of users, and realism. This work may act as a reference point for researchers to start exploring which concrete co-design activities have better impact in achieving living lab aims.},

By exploring the field of Human-Food interaction (HFI) – a sub-area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) which aims to investigate the diversity of ways people interact with food – we therefore specifically examine the design space of edible anthropomorphic virtual agents (EAVAs). To understand human-to-food interactive communication, we conducted an interview study with 19 participants, followed by a co-design workshop on the design of conversational agents for personified food. Based on the results, we implemented a prototype called FoodChattAR that employs augmented reality and chatbots to interact and communicate with food. Our evaluation with 21 participants shows that FoodChattAR turns eating into fun, while at the same time the food conveys relevant societal facts about itself. We contribute to the field of HCI by introducing EAVAs as a novel human-to-food interaction.},

We report the results of a design workshop conducted among the authors who are design researchers in interactive narratives and food-based play. In the workshop, we discussed existing works, asynchronously brainstormed new food-based interactive storytelling systems, and then reconvened to discuss our ideas. We present the portfolio of designs that arose from this workshop, and the design themes that we synthesized from the portfolio. We recommend how to position people not just as observers, but as active participants in the interactive food-based storytelling system.},

Drawing on two cases, the analysis shows the ways in which digital technologies oftentimes overshadow communities' key concerns for care, and how attempts to design for community settings can result in anti-designs, that is sociotechnical configurations that can disrupt caring practices. The contribution of the paper is twofold: first, an analysis of the different configurations of caring and efficiency and, second, a focus on care in the design and appropriation of technologies into this space.},

The findings inform a conceptual framework of designing for user experience leveraging eating experiences. These findings also inform implications for HFI design suggesting the value of multisensory flavor experiences, external and internal sensory stimulation and deprivation, aspects of eating for communicating meaning, and designing with contrasting pleasurable and uncomfortable experiences. The article concludes with six charts as novel generative design tools for HFI experiences focused on sensory, emotional, communicative, performative, and temporal experiences.},

Digestive Tumble consists of nine modules, where the modules visualise a unique stage of the digestion. The system represents the digestion of five major food groups: grains, meat, vegetables, fruits and dairy through colourful tokens. Users interact with the system by inserting tokens representing their meal. These tokens transform into colourful beads, which then traverse through different modules to show the digestion of the given meal. We reflect upon the steps involved in visualising an internal bodily process through a tangible system. We hope that our design reflection will inspire future systems on visualising other internal bodily processes to support body learning through everyday reflection.},

As part of this movement, we present in this paper a serious game called Face-the-Waste that is meant to increase users food literacy and educate them about the impact and development of food waste. Our serious game comes in the form of a public installation that uses provocative design to engage the users. They had to answer multiple choice questions and if they answered wrongly real food would be disposed into a bin in front of the users eyes. The aim with this was to create a strong emotional response and increase the level of reflection on the topic. In our evaluation we not only found that the users often voiced very strong emotional reactions but also engaged and discussed the question and their content. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such provocations can add a new layer for the design of serious games.},

Drawing on environmental studies, we outline key concepts of environmental stewardship – namely actors, capacity, and motivations – to unpack how different initiatives for handling waste are organised, both through grassroots and top-down interventions, and through varying sociotechnical configurations. We use these dimensions to analyse three different cases of waste management that illustrate how actions of care for the environment are ecologically organised, and what challenges might hinder them beyond –or besides– behavioural motivations. We conclude with a discussion on the orientation to action that the suggested framework provides, and its role in understanding, designing and assessing digital technologies in this domain. We argue that examining how stewardship actions fold into each other helps design sociotechnical interventions for managing waste from within a relational perspective.},

  abstract  = {Persuasive technologies are interactive systems that are designed to influence people to change their attitudes or behaviours. Persuasive technologies have been used successfully in several domains including health to make people exercise more, shopping to make people buy specific products, and social media to make people contribute better content. In the area of sustainability, its use is not well documented. To contribute to the use of persuasive technologies in sustainability, this paper carries out a literature review of published articles in the area in the past five years and summarizes the main findings based on three main themes: the design and development of the technology to make it adaptive to users, the evaluation of the technology, and the findings from the evaluation. Our results suggest that most persuasive technologies are developed as mobile applications, IoT devices or serious games and the most common behaviour change targeted by the persuasive technologies in this domain are energy conservation and sustainable food management. The most common persuasive strategies that are used are rewards, suggestions and self-monitoring. In terms of evaluation, a self-reported evaluation method was applied by most authors. While the range of evaluation of the developed persuasive technologies was between one hour and one year, the number of recruited participants ranged from two to over nine hundred. The findings from the evaluation were mostly mixed with several authors reporting positive results (behaviour change) for some participants. Based on these results, we suggest considerations for the development of future persuasive technologies for sustainability.},

  abstract   = {Reflection is a commonly addressed design goal in commercial systems and in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Yet, it is still unclear what tools are at the disposal of designers who want to build systems that support reflection. Understanding the design space of reflection support systems and the interaction techniques that can foster reflection is necessary to enable building technologies that contribute to the users' well-being. In order to gain additional insight into how interactive artefacts foster reflection, we investigated past research prototypes and reflection-supporting smartphone applications (apps). Through a structured literature review and an analysis of app reviews, we constructed four design resources for reflection: temporal perspective, conversation, comparison and discovery. We also identified design patterns in past digital artefacts that implement the resources. Our work constitutes intermediate-level knowledge that is intended to inspire future technologies that better support reflection.},

They focus on promoting social, economic, and ecological sustainability within local communities. However, prior research uncovered emergent challenges of these communities that prevent their endurance and growth. Despite growing academic interest in studying these communities, designers found it difficult to effectively adopt newly generated knowledge in practice. Addressing the research-practice gap, we developed a translational resource for design practitioners to conceptualize new value-added features for supporting technologies in the sharing economy context. Specifically, we synthesized emergent challenges in non-profit sharing economy communities and key social and environmental sustainability efforts in design research into a familiar format for designers – the card-based toolkit to support generative design activities. Beyond introducing the toolkit, we offer a “how-to” guide for its adoption in collaborative settings.},

To that end, we contrast two surplus redistribution solutions to this paradox. (1) Local independent donations between producers and donation centers. (2) Redistribution by way of a global redistributor (what we will call a core redistributor) who collects donations from all available producers and redistributes the surplus to all donation centers respective of their demanded quantities. We mathematically show that an optimal allocation of the surplus that minimizes waste and maximizes social welfare is only possible with a core redistributor. As this is a deeply social and economic problem rather than mathematical, we also qualitatively study two cases; (1) food waste and food insecurity in the UK, and (2) Los Angeles County’s project RoomKey: a pandemic effort to house covid-vulnerable unhoused persons in vacant hotels and motels. Both case studies give more support for a core redistribution as a solution to waste from overproduction and lack of access to essential resources.},

These attributes can be understood as characteristics of a product; the consequences can be seen as benefits arising from this product’s use; the values represent the end goals important to the consumer or the motivation to use the product. Means-end chain analysis originates in marketing and relates consumers and products. In the context of systems, what drives a product to be accepted by users. Problem: To understand the application of the means-end theory in the IS area to identify factors that lead to user acceptance of a system. Solution: To conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to understand how means-end theory helped understand user acceptance of technology. IS Theory: This work was inspired by the Technology Acceptance Model Theory, which helps to determine an individual’s intention to use a system. Methodology adopted: The SLR searched for scientific articles published in the last five years that contained the keywords “means-end”, “technology adoption”, “technology acceptance”, “technology resistance”, “user adoption”, “user acceptance” and “user resistance”. The search was carried out in the databases of ACM, Elsevier (ScienceDirect), and IEEE, and also by Google Scholar. Summary of results: 13 articles were selected. From the analysis of these articles, we extracted guidelines on data collection, number of recommended participants, indicators of data reliability, and data analysis. Contribution and Impact in the IS area: The results can benefit further studies applying means-end theory for analysis and survey of software requirements, particularly considering the most important values for end users.},

As a preliminary step in this research work, we organized a focus group with seven participants aimed at: i) investigating the potential of Conversational Agents - integrated with digital devices - to promote a more sustainable behavior at home; ii) eliciting the requirements on conversational interaction that such CAs should meet for this purpose. From the experience and findings of the focus group, we distilled a conceptual framework called CANDY, which highlights the core design dimension of Conversational Agents for Sustainability, and can be used to guide the processes of requirements elicitation and design for this category of CAs.},

Co-design workshops explored these to produce sociotechnical strategies using the festival timeline as a frame, with one of these, a patron planning tool chosen for further development. This paper contributes new insights on how information and communication technologies might enhance sustainable practices by facilitating relational change through better organisation, evaluation, and feedback.

Little, however, is known as to which practices these crowdfarms use to tackle the macrotasks, and this goes hand in hand with the current practice of the HCI research community to treat all forms of complex crowdsourcing work as practically the same. However, macrotasks differ substantially regarding structure and decomposability. Treating them under one umbrella term - macrotasking - can lead to an imprecise understanding of the workforce involved. We address this gap by examining the work practices of 31 Chinese crowdfarms on the four main macrotask types, namely: modular, interlaced, wicked, and container macrotasks. Our results confirm essential differences in how these nascent crowd organizations address different macrotasks and shed light on what platforms can do to improve the uptake of such work.},

In this paper, we argue for a better understanding of the different conceptions of ‘fairness’ which inform volunteer and guest practice and in turn mediate community-building efforts. We examine the practices surrounding ‘SharingEvent’ and challenges faced to sustainability by the heterogenous, and sometimes contested, commitments of the people involved. We further consider how ICT provided opportunities for explicit examination of ideological differences concerning what ‘sharing’ might mean. Our findings show that community building is dependent on the negotiation of different values and purposes identified. We derive recommendations for action-oriented researchers ultimately concerned with systemic transformation.},

Information including composting locations and amount of food discarded are displayed through an OLED screen, and tail wagging is operated by a Servo motor. CoCo was designed over several iterations based on feedback received from users through surveys, interviews and observations, as well as from subject matter experts through the Delphi method.

This paper introduces FoodFighters a mobile serious game aimed at encouraging young adult players to interact with their food items thereby making them more memorable. FoodFighters works by taking pictures of food items, that then can be customized into so called Food Fighters, which are then used to battle other players/friends fighters.

This study combines photo-based journaling, reflective questions and data visualization for triggering momentary and retrospective self-reflection. We prototyped a photo-based journaling app and conducted a 5-week field study (N=13) to observe in-the-wild experiences. Following, we conducted an evaluation workshop (N=9) to explore strategies for motivating reflective question answering and retrospective self-reflection. Our approach encourages momentary and retrospective self-reflection, but the question-answering process could be burdensome and retrospective self-reflection should be incentivized. For that, we compiled design strategies for both kinds of self-reflection. We contribute to the HCI literature with strategies for unifying momentary and retrospective self-reflection in photo-based journaling.},

  abstract  = {In the post-epidemic era, online teaching has become a trend, and "workshop" as an important teaching practice method for design disciplines has also been moved online. The teaching format of the workshop is usually practice-oriented, and many factors such as geographical distance and time difference have a great influence on the development of online teaching activities. Taking the teaching practice of the POLAR International Workshop as an example, this study obtained detailed experience and suggestions on the practical process and activities of the workshop through one-to-one semi-structured interviews with the participants in the workshop. Card sorting was used to analyze the users' information data, from the results, an online design workshop construction model was extracted. This qualitative study focused on how to create an online design workshop with a better experience. The online design workshop construction model in the post-epidemic era should start with three aspects, which were workshop agenda advancement, design work development and teamwork communication, focusing on the experience and feelings of participants. This study provided a structured empirical reference and guidance framework for the development of online workshop teaching activities in design disciplines in the future.},

In this paper, we report on a Research through Design project aimed at designing and evaluating a data physicalization for supporting collective sense-making of the climate impact of food. Throughout the design process, we have explored the materiality of CO2 emissions and ways to design with less resource use. The resulting data physicalization, Carbon Scales, was evaluated in a three-week field study with 27 participants. Our findings show that collective sense-making can be enabled through interactive data physicalizations and that this can lead to carbon literacy. We expand on a) sustainability through design by arguing for the value of artifacts that let people stay in the interaction as this can support collective sense-making and b) sustainability in design by showcasing the value of designing with an interaction-first and materials-second mindset.},

However, microbe-embedded artefacts present a challenge of temporal dissonance, reflected by a “time lag” typically experienced by humans in noticing the gradual and minute shifts in microbial metabolism. This could compromise fluency of interactions and may hinder timely noticing and attending to microbes in living artefacts. In addressing this challenge, we introduce Cyano-chromic Interface, in which photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803) is timely surfaced by an electrochromic (EC) material through its monochromatic display. Grounded through interface performance characterization and design primitives, we developed application concepts through which we instantiate how the interface can be tuned for diverse functional and experiential outcomes in living artefacts. We further discuss the potential of aligning human-microbe temporalities for enriched interactions and reciprocal relationships with microbes, and beyond.},

Therefore, we present a design exploration of different ways of faceting contributed data: by week, day, or person. Specifically, we designed Edo, a PDP that allows a small community to contribute their data to a physical visualization showing the climate impact of their dietary choices. In this pictorial, we elaborate on the design process of Edo and reflect on the findings of a three-week deployment of different layouts of Edo.

Transferring these cues into the design of robots and other artificial agents that interact with people may foster more natural, inviting, and accessible experiences. In this article, we offer a series of definitive nonverbal codes for human–robot interaction (HRI) that address the five human sensory systems (visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and gustatory) drawn from the field of communication studies. We discuss how these codes can be translated into design patterns for HRI using a curated sample of the communication studies and HRI literatures. As nonverbal codes are an essential mode in human communication, we argue that integrating robotic nonverbal codes in HRI will afford robots a feeling of “aliveness” or “social agency” that would otherwise be missing. We end with suggestions for research directions to stimulate work on nonverbal communication within the field of HRI and improve communication between people and robots.},

  abstract  = {The ability to assess the quality of fruit and vegetables at scale can revolutionize the agriculture sector and significantly reduce food waste. In this paper, we present AgriTera, a novel solution for accurate non-invasive, and contract-free fruit ripeness sensing via sub-terahertz wireless signals. The key idea is that sugar and water concentrations in fruit (that are associated with fruit ripening) leave unique non-uniform footprints in the wide band spectrum of the reflected signal off of the fruits. AgriTera utilizes the sub-THz bands for its wide bandwidth, sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the peel as well as the pulp underneath the peel. We develop a chemometric model that translates the reflection spectra to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We conduct extensive over-the-air experiments with commercially available sub-THz transceivers. We compare our results with ground truth values captured by a specialized quality sensor and a vision-based scheme that infers ripeness based on changes in the appearance of the fruit. We demonstrate that AgriTera can accurately estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruit with an average Normalized RMSE value of 0.55\%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceivable by the consumer.},

We worked with Newcastle City Council in the UK, whose Net Zero agenda has been formulated to mitigate and adapt to climate change, including by changing public perception and promoting more sustainable lifestyles. 32 final-year Animation and Interaction Design (IxD) undergraduate students worked in a collaborative design process to create seven site-specific public campaigns applying animation and projection mapping technologies. Educational challenges included working with new technology, delivering a professional quality result to an external client, and a short 8-week schedule. The results included an interactive game to engage the public in the concept of plastic bottle deposit recycling scheme; ‘guerilla’ projecting on a major clothing retail store intended to encourage passing shoppers to reflect on their role on the negative aspects of fast fashion; and an installation across some of the underground metro stations to highlight and celebrate the sustainability principles of public transport. Our contribution includes our case study of an agile structured collaborative process, with the dual focus of creating high-quality, engaging and site-specific creative content and promoting a specific aspect of the Council's policy agenda. Additionally, we discuss insights into tailoring projection mapping and animated content for civic communications purposes and encouraging digital animation students – who typically work on their production independently– to engage in collaborative processes and with civic responsibilities.},

Existing non-negotiable practices led to additional household consumption and we found different strategies households use to reach a shared-decision on food and energy use.

In response to this, we introduce FoodWise, a dual-component system tailored to inspire and incentivize campus communities to reduce food waste. The system consists of a data storytelling dashboard that graphically displays food waste information from university canteens, coupled with a mobile web application that encourages users to log their food waste reduction actions and rewards active participants for their efforts. Deployed during a two-week food-saving campaign at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in March 2023, FoodWise engaged over 200 participants from the university community, resulting in the logging of over 800 daily food-saving actions. Feedback collected post-campaign underscores the system’s efficacy in elevating user consciousness about food waste and prompting behavioral shifts towards a more sustainable campus. This paper also provides insights for enhancing our system, contributing to a broader discourse on sustainable campus initiatives.},

This evolution provides numerous benefits such as profit maximization, loss reduction, and the optimization of supply chain lead times. However, the use of such technologies has also considerably opened up various security threats and risks which have widened the attack surface on the entire end-to-end supply chain. We present a holistic survey on supply chain security. We discuss the different security issues and attacks that target the different supply chain technologies.

However, we know little about which conceptual aspects of gamification and which gamified elements are actually used in the context of sustainable food apps. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse 76 mobile apps from the Google Play Store found with the term ‘sustainable food’ of which we analyse 27 apps in detail using the Gameful Design Heuristics. Our analysis uncovers a low average heuristics score and an unbalanced usage of subheuristics and heuristic categories. Additionally, gamification is unevenly distributed among food themes and sustainability categories. This study’s results contribute to the research on commercial gamified apps related to sustainability and food. Thus, this paper contributes to gamification design by identifying design opportunities that serve as interesting starting points for future work.},

While sustainable HCI has identified relevant design narratives, little attention has been paid to those of communal energy projects. In this paper, we scope energy community literature at ACM to identify design narratives that tell stories about how energy communities are imagined and why they are relevant. Through a critical discourse analysis, we describe how design narratives currently shape energy community research on sites, participation, and digital technologies. We use these stories to discuss and suggest three trajectories of how future HCI researchers and practitioners may explore alternative and sustainable visions of energy community futures.},

Over the course of ten weeks, eight students and young professionals from a wide range of disciplines lived and worked together to build and self-experiment with technologies that integrate extended reality (XR), wearables, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and artificial intelligence (AI). Made possible by a residential community and interdisciplinary teams, this high-intensity model for HCI research and development (R&amp;D) was structured to encourage experimentation with atypical human-centered design methods and artistic practices.

We illustrate the inherent complexity of this process by considering six case studies from five countries on three continents. The contribution is an illustration of differentiated replication in multiple distributed participatory design case studies with children in different countries.

  abstract  = {In Canada, nearly 40\% of university students experience food insecurity [1, 2]. However, most young adults and students are not aware or even underestimate the extent of the insecurity they face. This phenomenon can increase the cognitive burden associated with food management, leading to poor resource allocation exacerbating levels of food insecurity. This negatively impacts Sustainable Development Goal 2, 'Zero Hunger.' The Canadian government and university institutions have often relied on food banks or charitable organizations. However, these interventions have mainly served as emergency measures rather than long-term solutions [3]. Through research based on a design-adapted ethnographic approach, our team has gained a deep understanding of the situation of university students and the challenges related to food. Consequently, we propose CookNook: an application featuring an intelligent personal assistant aimed at helping users prioritize cooking time by reducing the cognitive load associated with food. This is accomplished by providing simple and accessible recipes, accompanied by shopping lists tailored to their resources, needs, and constraints. CookNook also facilitates culinary gatherings with friends to share meals while motivating them to cook more. In this article, we summarize our design process and how our solution represents a step towards ensuring sufficiently quality nutrition among university students.},

Empowering consumers with the ability to assess the quality of fruit can be a game changer for reducing waste and motivating a healthier diet. In this paper, we present Meta-Sticker a novel low-cost non-invasive solution for accurate fruit sensing via a sub-THz metamaterial sticker. The key idea is to exploit fruit as a substrate for resonating meta-atoms. Changes in the chemical composite of the fruit over time (e.g., sugar and water concentration) yield variation in the dielectric properties of the fruit (here substrate). Interestingly, this would affect the resonant frequency of the Meta-Sticker. We design Meta-Sticker to resonate in the sub-THz bands for their sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the inner pulp of the fruit. We develop a model that translates the resonance of Meta-Sticker to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We fabricate Meta-Sticker on paper and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments. We demonstrate that our system can estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruits with an average Normalized RMSE value of 1.24\%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceptible by the consumer. Our design is non-invasive, low-cost (less than a cent), passive, biodegradable, and conformal.},

The game was evaluated with 14 participants, and the results show that the participants were able to quickly learn the sorting method and recall it after an extended period of time. Overall, the results suggest that FridgeSort succeeded in teaching users how to sort a fridge that can be applied to the real world and lead to a reduction in food waste.},

  abstract   = {The negative impact humans have on the environment is partly caused by thoughtless consumption leading to unnecessary waste. A likely contributing factor is the relative invisibility of waste: waste produced by individuals is either out of their sight or quickly taken away. Nevertheless, waste disposal systems sometimes break down, creating natural information displays of waste production that can have educational value. We take inspiration from such natural displays and introduce a class of situated visualizations we call augmented reality waste accumulation visualizations, or ARwavs, which are literal representations of waste data embedded in users’ familiar environment. We implemented examples of ARwavs and demonstrated them in feedback sessions with experts in pro-environmental behavior, and during a large tech exhibition event. We discuss general design considerations for ARwavs. Finally, we conducted a study with 20 participants suggesting that ARwavs yield stronger emotional responses than nonimmersive waste accumulation visualizations and plain numbers.},

  abstract  = {This research aims to explore the effectiveness of integrating a Digital Storytelling Project (DS) aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into English lessons to improve the reading skills of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in Taiwan. This quasi-experimental study involved 62 college students in a private university. The research employed various assessment tools, including initial and final assessments of English reading comprehension, alongside classroom observations. The reading scores were statistically analyzed using one-way ANCOVA. The findings of this investigation reveal that the treatment group exposed to the SDGs-based DS instruction exhibited better reading performance than the control group. Thus, using technology and integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the pedagogical framework offer distinct advantages in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction. This approach addresses the evolving educational landscape and caters to the multifaceted needs of contemporary learners..},

  abstract   = {Machine learning (ML) models are fundamentally shaped by data, and building inclusive ML systems requires significant considerations around how to design representative datasets. Yet, few novice-oriented ML modeling tools are designed to foster hands-on learning of dataset design practices, including how to design for data diversity and inspect for data quality. To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. With Co-ML, beginners can build image classifiers through a distributed experience where data is synchronized across multiple devices, enabling multiple users to iteratively refine ML datasets in discussion and coordination with their peers. We deployed Co-ML in a 2-week-long educational AIML Summer Camp, where youth ages 13–18 worked in groups to build custom ML-powered mobile applications. Our analysis reveals how multi-user model building with Co-ML, in the context of student-driven projects created during the summer camp, supported development of DDPs including incorporating data diversity, evaluating model performance, and inspecting for data quality. Additionally, we found that students’ attempts to improve model performance often prioritized learnability over class balance. Through this work, we highlight how the combination of collaboration, model testing interfaces, and student-driven projects can empower learners to actively engage in exploring the role of data in ML systems.},

Firstly, the influencing factors of online food delivery services’ risk are studied from the aspects of online food delivery platforms, restaurants, riders and customers. The risk factor system of online food delivery services is established according to the literature analysis method. Secondly, according to the characteristics of the risk, a risk assessment method combines best-worst method and grey target decision is constructed to measure the risk levels for different participants and risk factors. Finally, based on the risk assessment results, several decision schemes are proposed from the perspectives of participants. The grey target decision method is used to optimize the decision schemes, and after calculation, it is found that formulating the package standards to ensure food safety is the satisfactory decision scheme.},

Workers in packing stations are hired under seasonal contracts because of product seasonality and operations labor intensity. Seasonal workers, however, are usually characterized by inconsistent performance, high turnover and experience variation which leads to low productivity and high waste. Few mathematical models were used for evaluating fresh products packing operations, but in a deterministic nature which hinders the complexity and dynamics of the business processes. Hence, a hybrid Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) are employed to evaluate a set of seasonal recruiting policies in a large grape packing station. The paper aims to investigate the impact of workers experience on packing operations efficiency. The model outcomes demonstrate the improvement in operations efficiency and total running cost (about 20\% savings) that can be achieved when applying optimal recruiting policies that reduce labors variations.},

Building upon previous research focused on implicit communication of intention via actions, our model seeks to strategically influence an observer's belief using both the agent's actions and explicit messages. We show that our proposed model can be considered to be a special case of general multi-agent problems with explicit communication under certain assumptions. Since the mental state of the observer depends on histories, computing a policy for the proposed model amounts to optimizing a non-Markovian objective, which we show to be intractable in the worst case. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a technique based on splitting domain and communication actions during planning. We conclude with experimental evaluations of the proposed approach that illustrate its effectiveness},

Gameful systems are software programs that embed this concept and are increasingly being applied in various fields, such as environmental awareness, education and training, health, and food waste reduction. These systems are based on a set of rules defined by game designers, who specify the conditions that must be met to evolve the state of a game and the associated consequences. However, the current approaches to defining rules in gameful systems carry certain limitations that can give rise to undesirable or unforeseen behaviors. These limitations pose significant challenges to the smooth functioning and overall effectiveness of gameful experiences. This paper presents a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed to simplify and strengthen the entire rule lifecycle process. The DSL guides designers during the rule definition process using easy-to-use fluent APIs. Additionally, it enables the simulation of rules and verification of their behavior through a graph that explicitly shows their interconnection. Finally, the DSL facilitates the deployment of rules on the gamification engine with simple steps. This approach enhances the effectiveness of gameful systems by reducing the likelihood of unintended consequences and improving the overall user experience.},

With the sudden upraise of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a major concern for the healthcare industry to provide quality medical services to the common people. Vulnerable healthcare conditions have proven to be fatal for the patients. Conspicuously, it has become indispensable to assess the quality of healthcare services provided by the hospitals. The current article focuses on analyzing healthcare service quality delivered by the hospitals and healthcare centers. Specifically, the presented framework utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to acquire real-time ambient data inside smart hospitals. The quantification of the healthcare service is performed using the Probability of Health Grade (PoHG) to classify data segments using the probabilistic Bayesian belief model. Furthermore, the temporal data abstraction is performed for the numerical analysis of healthcare service quality in terms of the health quality index (HQI). Finally, a 2-player game theory-inspired decision modeling is performed to analyze healthcare quality in a time-sensitive manner. The proposed framework is assessed using a simulated environment where 225325 data segments are analyzed. Results are compared with state-of-the-art techniques in which enhanced performance measures are registered in terms of classification efficacy (93.74%), decision-making efficiency [coefficient of determination (95%), accuracy (97.53%), mean square error (2.01%), and root mean square error (1.95%)], temporal delay (96.62 s), and reliability (91.58%).},

  abstract  = {Nutritional food is the most important aspect for people to fulfil their daily needs, but nowadays, the change of lifestyle can affect the style of food consumption, for instance leaving food when they take a meal. Besides, food leftover causes loss of consumed nutrients. We took an observation in a canteen in Faculty of Agricultural Technology in University of Brawijaya produces lost of food about 1,142.5 gram per day. To prevent the amount of food waste, this paper proposes an early stage framework to create an automatic leftover estimation method using image segmentation based on color channel. So that, we can optimize of the amount of food served and avoid loss food nutritions hereinafter. We experimented in two types of background of tray box: black and gray, then an automatic cropping process based on each sub area of tray box is implemented. Each part of them contains an item of food, so we detect the area using color channel segmentation and implements B component in LAB color space. After getting the main area of food, then two areas between segmented food image are compared before and after being consumed. The calculation of the predicted leftover portion is calculated based on original weight of food item. The result shows that tray box with black background with constant (cd) is the best to project leftover, in which reaches 2.37 of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It proves that the propose method is sufficient to handle the leftover prediction of food.},

The effect of hand washing is also acknowledged by experts and the world health organisation (WHO). We propose a design based intervention employing behaviour change principles suitable for such households. The goal of the intervention was to nudge people to wash hands at appropriate times via self reflection. Our intervention induces self reflection through reminders and channel factors. We measured hand washing frequency to evaluate the change in behavior, and further investigated this habit through interviews. Results of our study indicate that channel factors bring significant change in hand washing behaviour than reminders.},

The designed course is "human-centric SE capstone", infusing design thinking methods and agile practices into the project life-cycle knowhow. The capstone was offered in spring of 2017 as a 16-week course for 29 students. Design thinking was effective to perform requirement elicitation, software design and testing. Also, the applied approach allowed students to be self-directed which increased their motivation, as a result there was zero dropout rate. Design thinking is a powerful mean of problem solving and effectively supports SE education in bringing a more hands-on and minds-on, problem-based curriculum.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, food wastage and childhood obesity are major issues. They are not only related to published health and economic matters but are also associated with the exhaustion of the environment and available natural resources. Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Globally, in 2016 the number of overweight children under the age of five was estimated to be over 41 million. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. In this context, the Green Deal and the “Farm to Fork” strategies introduced by the European Commission in 2020 support actions that can reduce food waste and change eating behavior to achieve a more sustainable society. One way to make children more aware of the environment and induce them to eat healthier food in the future is the introduction of educational games made by food waste through which they learn the importance of the environment and the health impact of the food they eat. This chapter describes an example of a food product designed for children, which, in the future, might help them to experience something educational and fun while taking care of a plant and watching it grow. It is also an opportunity to teach them to respect and care about the environment and follow a sustainable healthy diet when adults.},

  abstract = {Food waste from institutional food services accounts for a significant part of global food waste. Food waste sorting (FWS) at the source reduces waste management costs and environmental impacts in organizations. Yet what drives individual FWS behavior remains underexplored. This study explores the psychological process of FWS in institutional catering environments, integrating the value-belief-norm model, the theory of planned behavior, and self-determination theory. Data were collected from 431 university students in China and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results indicated the interplay of values, beliefs, norms, and motivations in shaping FWS behaviors. Social value orientations (SVO) indirectly affected FWS through awareness of consequences and personal norms. Subjective norms, potentially attributed to external regulations in canteens, influenced FWS intention through personal norms and induced FWS primarily via controlled motivations. The findings imply that behavioral strategies to induce FWS may leverage social influence and external regulation while also translating values and knowledge into intrinsic motivations through educational programs and awareness campaigns.},

To best understand the challenges in handling of fresh fruits and vegetables, it helps to trace those items in the home back through retail outlets, food service providers, distribution centers, transport, packing, harvest, and production practices. Unlike a supply chain which seeks to optimize efficiency between harvest and market, a value chain seeks to deliver high-quality product to the market. Of increasing interest in the management of postharvest chains is sustainability of produce from farm to market and reduction of food waste. Challenges in handling within a value chain include marketing equitably, handling items in stores, ensuring food safety, developing quality management plans, coping with constrained handling, minimizing physiological stress, and understanding transitions at purchase and harvest. Management programs must include an understanding of product flow from farm to home as well as money flow back through the chain. Simulation models (games) have been developed to better understand these flows and how to improve postharvest handling of fresh produce using systems-thinking practices.},

The development of these food habits during childhood depends on family, culture, familiarity, and accessibility, among other factors. Likewise, seeking attractive approaches for children, based on gamification and the use of new technologies and challenges, to transfer content and knowledge can guide their behaviour towards healthier and more sustainable food choices. A platform consisting in an interactive place where children can learn about food by playing will be developed and tested focused on kids and on their parents or caretakers. The platform will include different modules which will provide information regarding nutrition, sustainability, food waste, food science, sensory properties of food and technology specifically for children and adults. The use of chatbots for educational purposes is a recent topic that has been widely discussed and some examples support its development. There is a wide range of topics that can be addressed through chatbots so the tool will use the potential of chatbots so that children can learn the basics of healthy nutritional and sustainable habits from an early age, using a specific language according to their age range and understanding. To ensure that the tool and the AI behind it are adapted to the stage of development of children from different countries and provide the appropriate content, parents, caregivers, and other stakeholders as well as children themselves were consulted in Finland, Poland, and Spain to co-create the best solution. Therefore, cocreation activities were carried out with children, parents, and stakeholders using validated questionnaires, qualitative methodologies of co-creation or open in-depth interviews in these UE countries.},

  abstract            = {Food waste is a significant worldwide issue in landfill management. Due to improper implementation, technology applications related to food waste collection and its management system are still lacking in practice. The available applications have yet to address the issue of food waste management. Constructing an interactive mobile application is necessary for managing food waste collection for the decomposition process using Black Soldier Fly (BSF) treatment. Furthermore, as the mobile application requires participation from various user backgrounds, maintaining user involvement has become a priority. Gamification has emerged as one of the approaches that might favourably affect individual engagement behaviour. A comprehensive game element design is required where it focuses on how gamification can influence user engagement. This study aims to model the food waste gamified mobile application design to benefit Malaysia's decomposition ecosystem. It includes gamification, management features, and data visualization for reporting and will involve users from households, businesses, and the BSF farm. This paper presents the modelling process of a new mobile application design for this concept of study. The UX agile approach was used in gathering and designing the application requirements as it allows for active participation from all stakeholders. The result shows that the experts agree on the application design. This research will indirectly benefit the BSF industry in Malaysia, and it will have a significant impact on gamification, user experience, and food waste management in the direction of a sustainable environment. © 2022.

The present study evaluated whether the game would retain its efficacy if teachers were relieved of this task; presenting instead all game materials on visual displays in the school cafeteria. Materials and Methods: Participants were 572 children attending two Title 1 elementary schools (grades K-5). Following a no-intervention baseline period in which fruit and vegetable consumption were measured from food waste, the schools played the FIT Game. In the game, the children's vegetable consumption influenced events in a good versus evil narrative presented in comic book-formatted episodes in the school cafeteria. When daily vegetable-consumption goals were met, new FIT Game episodes were displayed. Game elements included a game narrative, competition, virtual currency, and limited player autonomy. The two intervention phases were separated by a second baseline phase (within-school reversal design). Simulation Modeling Analysis (a bootstrapping technique appropriate to within-group time-series designs) was used to evaluate whether vegetable consumption increased significantly above baseline levels in the FIT Game phases (P < 0.05). Results: Vegetable consumption increased significantly from 21.3 g during the two baseline phases to 42.5 g during the FIT Game phases; a 99.9% increase. The Game did not significantly increase fruit consumption (which was not targeted for change), nor was there a decrease in fruit consumption. Conclusion: Labor-reductions in the FIT Game did not reduce its positive impact on healthy eating. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

  abstract               = {Based on the status quo of festival food waste, we designed a conservation-oriented supply chain, which is a single-cycle food supply chain with two players, including one retailer and one supplier. The retailer, as a follower of the Stackelberg game, can receive the product from the supplier in two ways: at the wholesale price or as a call option. Meanwhile, there are two production modes of the product line: slow and rapid. When the retailer has determined the strike amount, under the early slow production mode, it is difficult to meet the rapid demand for festival food, and the supplier will shift to the rapid production mode. By the nature of the product, there is a certain deterioration rate. Furthermore, the demand achieves a maximum value before the festival, after which the demand plummets. Under the above conditions, we explore the optimal production strategy and the optimal pricing strategy. By comparing the forward contracts under the two benchmarks of centralized supply chains, and decentralized supply chains, our results indicate that, in a decentralized supply chain system, the optimal strike price, wholesale price, and option price are influenced by the retail price, food deterioration rate, and relevant cost. The discount price has no effect on the optimal price. Optimal profit is negatively correlated with demand risk, spoilage rate and production costs, and positively correlated with out-of-stock costs. Through the risk-sharing mechanism of an option contract, both the retailer and the supplier reduce their business risk. In addition, the decentralized supply chain's optimal profit value can be coordinated to the centralized supply chain profit value under certain conditions. © 2021},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a quantum game to study the food loss and waste (FLW) reduction in a two-echelon food supply chain (FSC) consisting of single supplier and single retailer. First, a Non-zero-sum game model based on the efforts of supplier and retailer in the process of FLW reduction is developed. Then, the classic strategy space is extended to quantum strategy space. The results show that in both classical environment and the separable quantum game scenario, it is difficult to achieve the Pareto optimal strategy of the two parties adopting the full effort strategy, because the full-effort party will bear the risk of betrayal by the non-effort party. However, in the context of maximally entangled quantum game, the risk causing by the non-effort party are borne by himself rather than the full-effort party. Correspondingly, both parties will adopt the full effort strategy to achieve a win-win situation and improve FLW in FSC significantly. Furthermore, an entanglement contract is proposed to ensure that neither of them has the motivation to deviate from the quantum strategy. Based on these findings, some managerial implications are presented to improve the level of cooperation and effort of the supplier and the retailer on FLW reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The amount of food wastage and the problems caused by food waste. Combining the FBM behavior model, an interactive design method for cultivating food-saving habits is proposed from three aspects: enhancing user motivation, improving user capabilities, and increasing trigger mechanisms. Interactive design methods such as immersive experience, timely and effective feedback, interesting game interactions, incentive mechanisms, and diversified choices can effectively promote users' understanding of food sources, growth and other knowledge, and cultivate knowledge in an interesting form, so that users can personally experience the hard-won food in the bowl, and then cultivate the user's sense of responsibility and mission to save food, and finally develop a good habit of saving food.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Moreover, the separation of certain waste fractions, such as food waste, is necessary to ensure that landfills and – more importantly – incinerators are managed properly. It is therefore necessary to examine the reasons and motivations for separating waste. Separation and recycling of waste fractions should decrease the overall cost of waste disposal for citizens and public bodies. This can only happen if the authorities take into consideration some important “stumbling blocks,” i.e. physical and socioeconomic indicators and prerequisites, when introducing a recycling system. Four examples (landfill tax as an incentive for separate collection, recycling of used paper and cardboard, collection of bio-waste, recycling of mixed packaging waste) have been investigated in order to evaluate the reasons for successful and unsuccessful attempts at resource recovery. Economic incentives for waste segregation are very important and should be tested in pilot studies or through simulation games, because major differences between opportunity costs and costs for alternative treatment options may lead to unwanted behavior by waste producers and/or citizens. Furthermore, citizens’ behavior regarding the separation of valuables, their cultural background with respect to waste management, and social norms must be taken into account when planning collection schemes. Obviously, convenient access to collection systems is essential. Citizens must become accustomed to these systems; long-term awareness raising helps to optimize the successful collection of recyclables. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

However, previous studies on serious supply chain games have not adequately addressed specific issues related to food products, such as supply-side fluctuations, dynamic pricing to balance fluctuating supply and demand, perishability of goods, dependence of the value of goods on the remaining life, delivery and sell-by deadlines, life-based discounting, and food loss reduction. In this study, we developed a new serious game for supply chains called the Milky Chain Game, which incorporates these food-product-specific issues. The game was tested on university students, and its educational effectiveness was examined. The results showed that the participants who were conscious of reducing food loss experienced a persistent undersupply of milk cartons in the game experiments, highlighting the challenge of balancing food loss reduction and consumer satisfaction. In the post-hoc questionnaire, six out of 10 participants expressed a desire to play the game again, indicating they had a positive impression of the Milky Chain Game. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

In this chapter, we use the example of a sustainable food system to illustrate the idea of a circular economy to real-world situations. Additionally, we investigate the shift to a circular alimentary system using the socio-technical transformation paradigm to sustainability. The food sector is anticipated to expand output as a result of estimates for global population expansion, which in turn will undoubtedly result in a rise in the total amount of waste produced. Considering this background, the formation of low-cost, eco-friendly materials is essential to sustainably cope up with energy demands. Hence, it is high time to adopt the circular economy principles in the plastic sector. The game-changing approach is to support and promote sustainable polymer technologies that separate plastics from fossil feedstocks. As a result, it can reduce packaging waste, enhance packaging design, and push for the adoption of bio-based, biodegradable, and compostable plastics. The current study focuses on effective approaches in the circular economy, especially the application of bio-polymer-based coatings and emulsions in food technology. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Surinder Singh, Suresh Sundaramurthy, Alex Ibhadon, Faisal Khan, Sushil Kumar Kansal, and S.K.

A card game embedding a clear trade-off between the temptation of additional gain and the risk of waste was devised. Decisions to purchase different multi-buy offers were recorded across individual and group decision-making. The results indicate that collaborative purchase decision-making could have some impact on the way in which the risk of waste is dealt with, consistent with social signaling and collective action. Compared to individual decision-making, group decision-making saw a deferral in choices to purchase multi-buy offers with an associated risk of wastefulness wen only a moderate temptation was added. These differences were embedded in both planned strategies and revealed behavior. Food waste is linked to marketing practices as well as household routines and perceived levels of control, particularly amongst households with multiple young adults. Shopping is typically conducted as an individual, however collaborative shopping experiences may help with planning and control, particularly amongst a student population. © 2018},

  abstract               = {Purpose: Currently, digital technology has been proposed as a new archetype for developing an effective traceability system in the perishable food supply chain (FSC). Implementation of such a system needs significant investment and the burden lies with the members of the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact on the profit of the supply chain members due to the implementation of an effective traceability system with such a large investment. The study also tries to explore the impact of the implementation of such a system by coordination among the members through a cost-sharing mechanism. Design/methodology/approach: A two-level supply chain that comprises a supplier and retailer is analyzed using a game-theoretic approach. The mathematical models are developed considering the scenario for an individual, centralized and both members invest using a cost-sharing mechanism. For each of the models, the impact of product selling price, information sensing price and quality improvement level on profit is analyzed through numerical analysis. Findings: The study reveals that consumer involvement can be a strong motivation for the supply chain members to initiate investment in the traceability system. Further, from an investment perspective cost-sharing model is beneficial compared to the individual investment-bearing model. This mechanism can coordinate as well as benefit the FSC members. However, the model is less beneficial to the centralized model from profit and quality improvement levels. Practical implications: Food wastage can be less from supplier and retailer perspectives. Moreover, consumers can purchase food items only after verifying their shipping conditions. Consequently the food safety scandals can be reduced remarkably. Originality/value: Digital technology adoption in the perishable FSC is still considered emerging.

We combine our personal compost with non-toxic binders to create a biomaterial that can completely biodegrade. We propose Intimate Making as an approach for working with ReClaym that leverages familiar, hands-on techniques to enhance maker-material communication, which in turn leads to a deeper material understanding. We explore methods to customize ReClaym via color, texture, sensing, and conductivity. We apply manual fabrication techniques (sculpting, molding, and hand-held extruding) and design explorations to create a collection of applications that include garden paraphernalia, games, and personal items found in the home. We then examine the entire life cycle of ReClaym, which both begins and ends with composting - giving food waste a second life and providing a sustainable end of life for ReClaym artifacts, thus making the process truly circular. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

However, the effect of relaxing the limits was found to vary depending on some conditions. Thus, to further understand how these limits affect food wastage, we take a game-theoretical analysis approach. In this approach, we formulate a normal-form game played by a manufacturer and a retailer in a milk supply chain, develop a simulation model of the chain, and use the simulator to obtain sample values of the players’ payoffs earned under every pair of their strategies. We then apply a statistical multiple comparison test to the data to identify the statistical best responses of a player to each opponent strategy, derive statistical Nash equilibriums, and compare the equilibriums obtained under different limits and consumers’ preferences. Consequently, it is confirmed that relaxing the limits may undesirably impact food waste. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

This chapter critically examines the link between ranks and competition by investigating the actors’ actual desire for the highest positions. Empirically, the author examines the role of the food waste hierarchy in establishing status competition in the food waste field. This discrete ranking creates ‘winners’ at the top (the challengers that prevent food waste by generating demand for it), who respond enthusiastically to the food waste hierarchy to benefit from status gains. In contrast, the ‘losers’ at the bottom (biogas plants) show very little interest in improving their position. They do not see themselves as players in such a competitive game and direct their attention towards other competitions outside the field. The chapter argues that ranks do not necessarily induce competition, since the actors may be involved in multiple competitions and decide whether it is worth pursuing high status within each one. © the several contributors 2021.},

To better meet customers' safety and quality expectations and reduce the loss of problematic products that fail to be recalled in time, the paper establishes a two-level food supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and supplier, uses the Stackelberg game to explore the interaction between traceability recall and product safety optimization in the food chain, and finds the best food safety investment and product traceability recall strategy. And we consider the case of the former investing in the latter's product safety efforts. The results show that the food safety premium sharing rate determines the optimal decision of manufacturers and suppliers when each member is faced with the difference between the loss cost of unrecalled food per unit and the traceable recall cost coefficient. In addition, the higher safety investment cost factor increases the burden on the entire supply chain and reduces the safety benefits of the food chain. Moreover, higher security investment cost factors increase the burden on the entire supply chain and reduce the safety benefits of the food chain. Interestingly, suppliers can take advantage of the increased cost per unit of unrecalled products to obtain higher safety investments when manufacturers implement recall measures for problematic foods. We also introduced blockchain technology and discovered Pareto optima for food safety. When the supplier bears part of the problem of food loss, food safety, quality, and investment are high. The conclusions show that product traceability recall is beneficial to the overall welfare of the food chain. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The increasing commercial value of food waste, as well as emerging opportunistic behaviours, make it difficult for the charging policy to perform as expected, consequently affecting the economic and environmental effectiveness of food waste-to-energy (WTE) program. A natural question is how to achieve the dual outcomes of reducing waste generation and attaining efficient energy utilisation within the above circumstances. This study considers the operational characteristics of food waste generators (FWGs) and food WTE firms in China, with an evolutionary game model constructed to analysis their interactive behaviours and strategic preferences. The results suggest that lowering the gate fee and increasing the punishment cost while setting a recovery cap could prevent the originally eco-friendly WTE program from being more wasteful, which is conducive to reducing waste generation and enhance energy utilisation simultaneously. There exists Liebig's law, i.e., by increasing the level of constraint (Average revenue of food waste recovered or punishment cost) could shift other evolutionary stable strategies (ESSs) towards the ideal ESS. We also provide scientific and feasible approaches for government to undertake and improve its charging policy. Our findings guide countries suffering from waste disposal and energy shortage on effective and efficient food waste management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract            = {Food waste presents a substantial challenge with significant environmental and economic ramifications, and its severity on campus environments is of particular concern. In response to this, we introduce FoodWise, a dual-component system tailored to inspire and incentivize campus communities to reduce food waste. The system consists of a data storytelling dashboard that graphically displays food waste information from university canteens, coupled with a mobile web application that encourages users to log their food waste reduction actions and rewards active participants for their efforts. Deployed during a two-week food-saving campaign at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in March 2023, FoodWise engaged over 200 participants from the university community, resulting in the logging of over 800 daily food-saving actions. Feedback collected post-campaign underscores the system's efficacy in elevating user consciousness about food waste and prompting behavioral shifts towards a more sustainable campus. This paper also provides insights for enhancing our system, contributing to a broader discourse on sustainable campus initiatives. © 2023 ACM.},

  abstract               = {The tradition of marketing only aesthetically agreeable produce by retailers contributes to a major source of food loss through “ugly veg”, i.e., the produce that does not look “regular”. In this paper, we examine the relations between different tiers of agri-food supply chains to study the impact of marketing ugly veg on different supply chain members and the food loss in the system. We examine and compare scenarios of a centralized supply chain, a traditional supply chain without ugly veg, an ugly veg supply chain with a single retailer offering both regular produce and ugly veg, and a two-retailer supply chain where an auxiliary retailer sells the ugly veg. We characterize the equilibrium decisions in these systems and also provide analytical results and insights on the effectiveness of different supply chain designs based on a comprehensive numerical study. We demonstrate the conditions under which the supply chain can reduce overall food loss. For sufficiently high cost of effort, selling ugly veg through the single retailer reduces food loss. Nonetheless, the grower is generally better off offering the ugly veg to an auxiliary retailer. We show that the ratio of food loss per cultivated land always decreases in the two-retailer supply chain, while the total food loss might increase for sufficiently high cost of effort. © 2023 The Author(s)},

  abstract               = {It is estimated that during FY 2018, food waste of 25.31 million tons and food loss of 6 million tons occurred in Japan. Of this total amount, 3.24 million tons of waste was generated from business, including the food manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and restaurant industries, and 2.76 million tons of waste was generated from households. Thus, it is crucial to mitigate both upstream and downstream food loss. As consumption patterns greatly influence not only downstream but also upstream food loss, special emphasis must be placed on increasing consumers’ awareness of this global issue, and several programs have been initiated to this end. Our research reveals that alongside awareness, enhancing consumers’ skills is of vital importance to efficiently reduce downstream food loss. Additionally, business operators must invest in improving the skills of those in charge to mini-mize food loss in commercial setups. Educating both consumers and businesses with the requisite skills to lessen food loss is equally essential. The authors are developing impactful serious games to help impart such education. These include a vegetable supply chain game (Veggie Mart Game), where consumers are players, and a milk supply chain game (Milky-Chain Game), where businesses are players.

  abstract               = {This paper examines the food waste separation initiative during the 29th Southeast Asia (SEA) Games. The study was conducted through a combination of survey questionnaires, focus interviews and observations, with the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as the theoretical background. In particular, 267 samples were analysed in relation to the qualitative responses of eight student volunteers obtained through a focus group interview; thus facilitating a comparative analysis between self-reported data and the observed behaviour of waste separation. The gap addressed is the lack of studies on recycling behaviour premised on such comparison. From the self-reported data, most participants professed pro-environmental attitudes and claimed to have used the food waste bin at Bukit Jalil National Stadium (Bukit Jalil). However, the observed behaviour showed limited food waste separation and widespread contamination. The prevalence of environmental message at Bukit Jalil had arguably pressured most participants into expressing socially desirable responses, thus resulting in an attitude-behaviour gap. Most participants were not astute to the operational errors in the recycling programme, namely the inconsistencies in the bin system and colour-coding. This would suggest the lack of recycling information and recycling skills, which coupled with the errors in recycling infrastructure, lowered the perceived behavioural control of food waste separation at Bukit Jalil. Experimental intervention was conducted, whereby volunteers closely supervised two food waste bins and assisted in the food waste separation process. It was found that high visibility of recycling behaviour exerted significant pressure on the spectators to separate food waste. The theoretical implication is the exposition of subjective norms as a determinant that influence an individual's professed attitudes towards the behaviour, in addition to influencing the behavioural intention. The managerial implication lies in demonstrating that the visibility of recycling behaviour reinforces the social pressure of recycling norm. The findings can be applied in the design of recycling stations with the view to improve recycling rate. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Public engagement with waste sorting is crucial to the diversion of solid waste from landfill and the reduction of contamination in waste streams. The current study aims to promote recycling and composting accuracy via a digital sorting game that provides immediate feedback. In this game, participants manually sorted items into four bins (food scraps, recyclable container, paper, and garbage) via a computer interface, and received immediate feedback on their performance after each trial. We found that immediate feedback improved sorting accuracy as measured by correct key presses (Experiment 1) or motion trajectory (Replication 1), even when feedback was no longer provided. This improvement in sorting accuracy remained a week after playing the game (Replication 2). We then implemented this game in residences, and found that after residents played this game, the weight of compost materials increased while the contamination rate decreased (Experiment 2). These findings suggest that providing immediate feedback in a digital sorting game can be an effective tool to engage and educate the public to increase recycling and composting rates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Discussing how to more successfully implement PAFW to reduce food waste is of great significance in achieving sustainable development.

A simulation-based approach is used to validate the theoretical results and analyze the influence of key parameters on the evolutionary trajectory. The study found the following: (1) to promote the system to an optimal evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), it is necessary to strengthen policy publicity, increase the willingness of large supermarkets to implement the PAFW, and increase the enthusiasm of the public or third-party organizations to monitor system; (2) stakeholders' initial willingness will influence the evolutionary trajectory; and (3) it is important to strengthen the institutional development of local government regulators, improve the local government's achievements, reduce the local government's regulatory costs, improve policies to support large supermarkets' implementation of the PAFW, and reduce the cost of implementing the PAFW for large supermarkets.  © 2021 Xichun Luo and Honghao Zhao.},

This study highlights the importance of food traceability in reducing food loss through the proper monitoring of food at every stage of the supply chain. The actions of individual players in a food supply chain affect its traceability. Moreover, the decisions made by one player influence the decisions of the other players. Thus, traceability becomes more complex as the number of players increases. Owing to the complex nature of a food chain, it is important to analyze all the possible strategies that stakeholders consider and understand the influence of those possible strategies on the traceability of a food supply chain. In this study, we deploy a game theory model to analyze the strategic combinations of all possible actions of different stakeholders to understand the complexities present in a food supply chain, as well as how these strategic combinations help in decision-making for the adoption of traceability in a food supply chain. Furthermore, we analyze the factors that may increase or decrease the probability of adopting traceability in a food supply chain. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract            = {This research investigates quality-based optimal pricing decisions of a supplier and a retailer in vertical Nash and Stackelberg games, where the game scenarios include with and without markdown pricing scenarios. Particularly, delivery lead time is formulated as a decision on quality-keeping effort, and the cost of food wastage resulting from unsold food is estimated. We found that the two-stage pricing model leads to lower food waste and better profit payoffs for both players than the single-stage model. Results also show that with limited market power, the retailer may sacrifice its sales margin under the Stackelberg game. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Inadequate food storage practices can lead to storing items in a way that leads to forgetting them until they become spoiled, increasing food waste. In this paper, we present FridgeSort, a serious mobile game that aims at teaching users how to sort their refrigerators with the underlying goal of reducing household food waste. The game was evaluated with 14 participants, and the results show that the participants were able to quickly learn the sorting method and recall it after an extended period of time. Overall, the results suggest that FridgeSort succeeded in teaching users how to sort a fridge that can be applied to the real world and lead to a reduction in food waste. © 2023 ACM.},

Tourism and hospitality contribute significantly, with food accounting for nearly half of the waste these sectors produce. One type of food waste – plate waste – could easily be avoided. Plate waste is the food people leave behind uneaten on their plates. It does not increase the enjoyment of the meal, yet costs the hotel money, and harms the environment. We develop and test – in a quasi-experimental field study – a game-based intervention that reduces plate waste by 34 percent, and is available for immediate adoption by hotels globally. Our study contributes to theory by demonstrating the power of increasing pleasure in pleasure-seeking contexts when aiming to change environmentally significant tourist behaviour. Our findings also challenge established behavioural theories, which postulate that people's beliefs are the key drivers of pro-environmental behaviour. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract               = {This research explores the value of data sharing in a two-echelon, fresh product supply chain consisting of a retailer and manufacturer. Demand is stochastic and price sensitive. Decision-making is decentralized and the supply chain operates with a simple linear wholesale price contract. We employ a game theoretic model in which the manufacturer is a Stackelberg leader. Although fresh product supply chains are ubiquitous in the marketplace, academic guidance is limited, particularly in the context of data sharing and when price is determined endogenously. Our analysis shows that although data sharing helps to improve product freshness and reduce waste, sufficiently improved product freshness is the key for both suppliers and retailers to benefit financially. Otherwise, either party or the entire supply chain can be worse off. We demonstrate that data sharing is most valuable when product is somewhat perishable and demand is volatile. For highly perishable or non-perishable products, the manufacturer benefits but the retailer is harmed. Our results suggest that the drivers that motivate retailers to share inventory data in a fresh product supply chain are distinct from extant knowledge. The results provide insight into strategies that not only improve both parties’ performance, but also reduce food waste at the same time. © 2022},

  abstract               = {Gamification refers to the application of gaming concepts in non-playful contexts to encourage engagement with a product or service. Gameful systems are software programs that embed this concept and are increasingly being applied in various fields, such as environmental awareness, education and training, health, and food waste reduction. These systems are based on a set of rules defined by game designers, who specify the conditions that must be met to evolve the state of a game and the associated consequences. However, the current approaches to defining rules in gameful systems carry certain limitations that can give rise to undesirable or unforeseen behaviors. These limitations pose significant challenges to the smooth functioning and overall effectiveness of gameful experiences. This paper presents a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed to simplify and strengthen the entire rule lifecycle process. The DSL guides designers during the rule definition process using easy-to-use fluent APIs. Additionally, it enables the simulation of rules and verification of their behavior through a graph that explicitly shows their interconnection. Finally, the DSL facilitates the deployment of rules on the gamification engine with simple steps. This approach enhances the effectiveness of gameful systems by reducing the likelihood of unintended consequences and improving the overall user experience.  © 2023 IEEE.},

  abstract               = {Human missions to establish surface habitats on the Moon and Mars are planned in the coming decades. Extraplanetary surface habitat life support systems (LSS) will require new capabilities to withstand anticipated unique, harsh conditions. In order to provide safe, habitable environments for the crew, water purification systems that are robust and reliable must be in place. These water purification systems will be required to treat all sources of water in order to achieve the necessary levels of recovery needed to sustain life over the long-duration missions. Current water recovery and purification systems aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are only partially closed, requiring external inputs and resupply. Furthermore, organic wastes, such as fecal and food wastes, are currently discarded and not recycled. For long-duration missions and habitats, this is not a viable approach. The inability to recycle organic wastes represents a lost opportunity to recover critical elements (e.g., C, H, O, N, P) for subsequent food production, water purification, and atmospheric regeneration. On Earth, a variety of technologies are available to meet terrestrial wastewater treatment needs; however, these systems are rarely completely closed-loop, due to lack of economic drivers, legacy infrastructure, and the (perceived) abundance of resources on Earth. Extraplanetary LSS provides a game-changing opportunity to incentivize the development of completely closed-loop systems. Candidate technologies may be biological, physical, or chemical, with associated advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents a survey of potential technologies, along with their inputs, outputs and requirements, which may be suitable for next-generation regenerative water purification in space. With this information, particular technologies can be down-selected for subsystem integration testing and optimization. In order for future space colonies to have closed-loop systems which minimize consumable inputs and maximize recovery, strategic implementation of a variety of complementary subsystems is needed. © 2019 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR)},

With the motive of producing organic fertilizers and conserving the environment, expired food can be collected and recycled. This study examines the hypothesis that leasing recycling facilities from peri-urban areas, due to the ban on reproduction operations in the city centers, can manage the recycling system participants’ relationship and enhance sustainability in urban communities. The problem has been investigated under two separate sources of uncertainty, namely, quality and capacity. In the first scenario, a recycling system consisting of a commercial food service located in urban areas, a food waste collection agency, and a suburban fertilizer factory is optimized, in which the commercial food service leases the fertilizer factory’s facilities for recycling operations. In the second scenario, the two factories’ relationship, in which the first factory can rent the second factory’s facilities in case of capacity shortage, is managed through hybrid contracts and mathematical programming models. The results show that the whole system optimization and Pareto Improvement results for all members are guaranteed under proposed hybrid contracts. These conclusions can help food recycling system managers have a better relationship with other players in their supply chains and enhance their credibility for caring about the environment, social concerns, and government compliance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract               = {Persuasive technologies are interactive systems that are designed to influence people to change their attitudes or behaviours. Persuasive technologies have been used successfully in several domains including health to make people exercise more, shopping to make people buy specific products, and social media to make people contribute better content. In the area of sustainability, its use is not well documented. To contribute to the use of persuasive technologies in sustainability, this paper carries out a literature review of published articles in the area in the past five years and summarizes the main findings based on three main themes: the design and development of the technology to make it adaptive to users, the evaluation of the technology, and the findings from the evaluation. Our results suggest that most persuasive technologies are developed as mobile applications, IoT devices or serious games and the most common behaviour change targeted by the persuasive technologies in this domain are energy conservation and sustainable food management. The most common persuasive strategies that are used are rewards, suggestions and self-monitoring. In terms of evaluation, a self-reported evaluation method was applied by most authors. While the range of evaluation of the developed persuasive technologies was between one hour and one year, the number of recruited participants ranged from two to over nine hundred. The findings from the evaluation were mostly mixed with several authors reporting positive results (behaviour change) for some participants. Based on these results, we suggest considerations for the development of future persuasive technologies for sustainability. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The need for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is felt across “agriculture food supply chain (AFSC)” to tackle the global demand for food items and concerns regarding food safety and security. Further, this transformation is possible due to recent advancements in I4.0 technologies, including “Internet-of-Things (IoT), Blockchain, Big Data (BD), Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Cloud Computing (CC) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS)” etc. Each of these technologies has a specific role in making the AFSC eco-system smart enough to address today's world challenges. Thus, this paper reviews these major technologies in AFSC to understand their applications and recent trends. The review is based on 146 articles from the “Scopus and Web of Science” database. The articles include peer-reviewed journals published between 2010 and 2020. The applications of reviewed technology in AFSC are analysed under five research dimensions, namely traceability and food safety, information system management, food waste, control and monitoring, decision making and agribusiness, and other miscellaneous-based applications. The study suggests that the integration of reviewed technologies can be more useful to provide low-cost solutions and empower sustainability in AFSC. Further, blockchain can emerge as a game-changer to ensure food safety and security. The current challenges and future research agenda in concerned themes are also identified to further motivate researchers to develop this area. This is the first paper that summarises the recent developments of six technologies for AFSC research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of ubiquitous computing and mobile technologies, mobile apps are tailored to support users to perform target behaviors in various domains, including a sustainable future. This article provides a systematic evaluation of mobile apps for sustainable waste management to deconstruct and compare the persuasive strategies employed and their implementations. Specifically, it targeted apps that support various sustainable waste management activities such as personal tracking, recycling, conference management, data collection, food waste management, do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, games, etc. The authors who are persuasive technology researchers retrieved a total of 244 apps from App Store and Google Play, out of which 148 apps were evaluated. Two researchers independently analyzed and coded the apps and a third researcher was involved to resolve any disagreement. They coded the apps based on the persuasive strategies of the persuasive system design framework. Overall, the findings uncover that out of the 148 sustainable waste management apps evaluated, primary task support was the most employed category by 89% (n = 131) apps, followed by system credibility support implemented by 76% (n = 112) apps. The dialogue support was implemented by 71% (n = 105) apps and social support was the least utilized strategy by 34% (n = 51) apps. Specifically, Reduction (n = 97), personalization (n = 90), real-world feel (n = 83), surface credibility (n = 83), reminder (n = 73), and self-monitoring (n = 50) were the most commonly employed persuasive strategies. The findings established that there is a significant association between the number of persuasive strategies employed and the apps’ effectiveness as indicated by user ratings of the apps. How the apps are implemented differs depending on the kind of sustainable waste management activities it was developed for. Based on the findings, this paper offers design implications for personalizing sustainable waste management apps to improve their persuasiveness and effectiveness.

	abstract = {Reducing food waste is a priority for all sectors of society as it threatens national food security and the sustainability of global agriculture. Many studies on food waste have focused on a single subject, and the psychological factors of consumer waste are often overlooked. Based on evolutionary game theory, this paper introduces consumers’ normative illusion, constructs an evolutionary game model in which the government, caterers and consumers collaborate to reduce food waste, and simulates and analyses the behavioural strategies of the three stakeholders. The results show that: Firstly, food waste can be reduced under certain conditions by incentive-guided and punishment-inhibited policies. Moreover, incentive-guided policies can reduce government expenditures more than punishment-inhibited ones. Secondly, implementation of prior intervention, the resultant intervention and reducing the probability of consumers’ aversion to the intervention of caterers can optimise the government’s punishment-inhibited policy. Finally, under the punishment-inhibited policy, caterers can bear 60% of the prior intervention costs for food waste management. When caterers invest 40–60% of the prior intervention costs, both caterers and consumers can achieve the ideal state of cooperation; caterers can accept 40% of the resultant intervention cost for food waste management, and when the resultant intervention cost is less than 40%, consumers choose not to waste. Both caterers and consumers are involved in reducing food waste when the probability of consumer dissatisfaction with a caterer’s intervention is reduced to less than 40%. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, several digital tools have been designed to provide consumers with nutritional and environmental impact information about their food choices post-consumption. Many of these tools lack behavioral change modules, have low user engagement, and ignore inherent environmental nutrition trade-offs to stimulate dietary change. This study presents the design and development of a decision support system to enhance consumer health while meeting sustainability goals from a pre-consumption perspective. The proposed decision support system, Dashboard for Improving Sustainable Healthy (DISH) food choices, employs behavioral features, traffic light labels, and nudges to inform end-users about the nutritional health performance and environmental impact of meals. DISH uses a simple metric that allows end-users to explore the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained or lost from consuming 100 kcal of a meal. The metric combines the positive or negative nutritional health effects (μ-DALYs) of consuming a meal and environmental damage (endpoint impact expressed in DALYs) on human health. In the DISH application, end-users are rewarded or deducted EnCoins, which represent the number of silver or gold coins lost or gained based on the cost ($) of environmental damage (midpoint impacts) of a meal compared to reference sustainable healthy and unsustainable and unhealthy meal. DISH's gamification module enables end-users to track the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained/lost and gold or silver rewards or deductions from consuming 100 kcal of a selected meal through cumulative minutes gained or lost and EnCoins. In promoting a sustainable diet culture, the gamification module enables users to create groups and communities where friends and families can track their sustainability performance through meal decisions. The DISH application is currently available online and can be accessed by an end-user through any device. Further pilot studies will focus on testing the technology in partner campus cafeterias. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Food waste is a major contributor to climate change. Schools offer a unique opportunity to educate on this issue while also reducing food waste generation; however, few climate-change education curricula that include a food waste component have been developed and tested with fidelity. Thus, the purpose of this cluster randomized controlled study was to assess the effectiveness of a climate change and food waste education program called NJ Leaves No Bite Behind (NJLNBB) among fifth-grade students. Lessons on food waste and sustainable food behaviors were developed that aligned with NJ Student Learning Standards for Climate Change and Next-Generation Science Standards. Participants (n = 162) completed pre- and post-test surveys that assessed knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behaviors. Post-test, the experimental group (n = 102) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher mean scores in knowledge, social norms, behavioral intentions, and perceived behavioral control compared to the control group (n = 60), with medium effect sizes, as determined by partial eta-squared. There were no significant between-group differences in mean score attitudes, self-efficacy, motivation to comply, or climate-friendly behaviors post-test. Almost three-quarters of participants who received the program agreed or strongly agreed the lessons were fun (75.5%), liked the card games (72.5), and learned a lot (78.4%). These findings are promising in terms of teaching adolescents the impacts of food waste on the climate. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: The objective of this meta-narrative review was to identify, organise and map the literature on food provision and nutrition support at the summer and winter Olympic and Paralympic Games (OPG) and similar major competition events over the past 21 years. This builds on a comprehensive update of a previous historical review of the evolution of food provision at the summer Olympic Games up until 2000 and considers contemporary issues such as the global pandemic and sustainability goals. Methods: A range of sources included primary research and review articles, edited book chapters, theses, conference papers or abstracts, International Olympic Committee reports, Organising Committees’ food vision and post-Games reports, independent professional reports, and media and periodicals including magazines and trade journals. The search strategy included four steps: a database search that complied with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews criteria, a search of the Olympic Studies Centre, a review of reference lists for unpublished sources, and a Google search for additional media reports. The researchers followed an iterative process where emerging narratives were discussed, recorded and refined as data were extracted. Results: The data from 229 records were extracted into a spreadsheet and grouped according to the type of evidence and specific event, then presented chronologically to give a perspective on the development of food provision and nutrition support. Eleven narratives emerged from the data extraction: ‘description of meals, menus and food’, ‘vision of the food provision’, ‘food safety’, ‘catering company involvement’, ‘sponsorship or contracts with food companies’, ‘athlete perspective’, ‘stakeholder perspective’, ‘athlete food intake,’ ‘nutrition input in food provision’, ‘food environment’ and ‘sustainability’. Conclusion: Results suggest that athletes' dining expectations, organising committee budgets, expert input and current global trends have led to food delivery changes. The OPG food environment has the capacity to positively influence the dietary choices of athletes and teams, while evolving to meet contemporary global challenges such as COVID-19 and sustainability targets. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Collegiate sporting venues have been leading efforts toward zero-waste events in pursuit of more sustainable operations. This study audited the landfill-destined waste generated at the University of Missouri (MU) football stadium in 2014 and evaluated the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy use associated with waste management options, including options that do and do not comply with zero-waste definitions. An estimated 47.3 metric tons (mt) of waste was generated, the majority (29.6 mt waste) came from off-site, pre-game food preparation activities; of which over 96 percent (%) was pre-consumer and un-sold food waste. The remaining 17.7 mt originated from inside the stadium; recyclable materials accounting for 43%, followed by food waste, 24%. Eleven waste management strategies were evaluated using theWaste Reduction Model (WARM). Results indicate that scenarios achieving zero waste compliance are not necessarily the most effective means of reducing GHG emissions or energy use. The two most effective approaches are eliminating edible food waste and recycling. Source reduction of edible food reduced GHGs by 103.1 mt (carbon dioxide equivalents) CO2e and generated energy savings of 448.5 GJ compared to the baseline. Perfect recycling would result in a reduction of 25.4 mt CO2e and 243.7 GJ compared to the baseline. The primary challenges to achieving these reductions are the difficulties of predicting demand for food and influencing consumer behavior. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Halving food waste by 2050 as per the Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 is key to securing a food system that is sustainable. One approach to reducing household food waste is through education campaigns. We recruited 501 households divided into three types of intervention groups and compared with a control group to better understand the efficacy of diverse education campaign approaches. Food waste interventions included a passive approach (handouts), a community engagement approach, and a gamification approach. We conducted waste audits, household surveys (pre-and post-intervention), and a focus group at the end of the campaign. The passive and gamification groups had similarly high levels of participation, while participation in the community group was very low. The passive group and the gamification group had higher self-reported awareness of food wasting after the campaign and lower food wastage than the control group. Waste audits found marginally significant differences between the game group and the control (p = 0.07) and no difference between the other campaign groups and the control group in edible food wasted. Frequent gamers were found to generate less edible food waste than infrequent gamers. We conclude that the evidence about the potential for gamification as an effective education change tool is promising and we recommend further study. © 2020 by the authors.

However, these approaches are criticized for not paying enough attention to everyday consumption practices and hence for not being successful in the long term. Therefore, we argue for a broader perspective on studying the role(s) of digital media supporting people in their transition towards more sustainable food consumption. To understand such roles, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 9 vegans. Our findings highlight an intensive use of (digital) media, especially in the early phase of changing consumption practices. Instead of gamification or persuasive design, media triggers initial irritation, provides information to develop a vegan-specific consumption knowledge and connects like-minded people. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

  abstract               = {Product expirations at retail stores erode profits and burden the environment. We investigate whether manufacturers can leverage salesforce compensation design as a waste-reduction tool. We propose a data-driven framework that uses structural econometric modeling and agency theory. Our analysis starts with a game theoretic model in which a salesperson interacts with a manufacturer that reimburses retailers and penalizes its own salesforce for expired products. We then use our model’s equilibrium outcome to estimate factors that determine the effort exerted by the sales representatives of a consumer-packaged-goods manufacturer. We first show theoretically that a manufacturer can simultaneously increase profits and reduce waste by increasing its sales representatives’ penalty for product expiration that occurs at the retailer. Based on this, we formulate a manufacturer’s profit maximization problem to compute optimum expiration penalties. Solving this problem for the manufacturer, we find the potential to simultaneously reduce waste and improve profits for 14% of the product–market combinations in our dataset. For these cases, we find that charging the salesperson 2.1 times the commission (on average) for each expired unit can increase the manufacturer’s profits by 0.58% and reduce waste by 23.3%. This study determines that a profit-seeking manufacturer can reduce waste at retailers by optimizing its salesforce incentive structure. Our work bridges the salesforce compensation and sustainable operations literatures. Furthermore, our framework allows consumer-packaged-goods manufacturers to identify win-win opportunities for the environment and their bottom line. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society},

  abstract            = {Nowadays, food wastage and childhood obesity are major issues. They are not only related to published health and economic matters but are also associated with the exhaustion of the environment and available natural resources. Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Globally, in 2016 the number of overweight children under the age of five was estimated to be over 41 million. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. In this context, the Green Deal and the “Farm to Fork” strategies introduced by the European Commission in 2020 support actions that can reduce food waste and change eating behavior to achieve a more sustainable society. One way to make children more aware of the environment and induce them to eat healthier food in the future is the introduction of educational games made by food waste through which they learn the importance of the environment and the health impact of the food they eat. This chapter describes an example of a food product designed for children, which, in the future, might help them to experience something educational and fun while taking care of a plant and watching it grow. It is also an opportunity to teach them to respect and care about the environment and follow a sustainable healthy diet when adults. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Food waste can meet diverse demand if treated harmlessly while may bring severe environmental problems if managed improperly. China is currently trying to facilitate food waste harmless disposal and resource utilization by urban food waste management. However, conflicts of interest among government departments, restaurants and waste disposal companies often make it difficult to achieve effective urban food waste management. This paper conducts a theoretical modeling and simulation analysis of behavioral strategy interaction of the above three participants by a combination of evolutionary game and system dynamics approach. To avoid opportunistic behaviors and regulation inefficiency that occurred in fixed penalty scheme (F-scheme), we introduce random inspection penalty scheme (R-scheme) to the tripartite evolutionary game in urban food waste management. Then an in-depth scenario analysis under F-scheme and R-scheme is carried out to investigate the influences of key variables on strategy evolution of participants. The results indicate that, compared with F-scheme, R-scheme contributes to both system stability promotion and practicality enhancement. Food waste treatment fee and regulation cost are influencing factors that respectively affect the strategic choices of restaurants and government departments. To a certain extent, exposure probability that represents informal regulation of the public and NGO can improve urban food waste management. Therefore, it is critical for government departments to adopt R-scheme, take advantage of the informal regulation of the public and NGO, gradually reduce food waste treatment fee and maintain a reasonable regulation cost to improve urban food waste management, thereby promoting food waste harmless disposal and resource utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

To best understand the challenges in handling of fresh fruits and vegetables, it helps to trace those items in the home back through retail outlets, food service providers, distribution centers, transport, packing, harvest, and production practices. Unlike a supply chain which seeks to optimize efficiency between harvest and market, a value chain seeks to deliver high-quality product to the market. Of increasing interest in the management of postharvest chains is sustainability of produce from farm to market and reduction of food waste. Challenges in handling within a value chain include marketing equitably, handling items in stores, ensuring food safety, developing quality management plans, coping with constrained handling, minimizing physiological stress, and understanding transitions at purchase and harvest. Management programs must include an understanding of product flow from farm to home as well as money flow back through the chain. Simulation models (games) have been developed to better understand these flows and how to improve postharvest handling of fresh produce using systems-thinking practices. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Global food systems are broken and in need of profound change. These imbalances and vulnerabilities are particularly strong in cities, where most of the global population lives and that are at the core of the major challenges linked with food production and consumption. The food system transition needs cities as key game-changers towards more sustainable, equitable, healthier and fairer food systems. Against this backdrop, the present article analyses the role of food policies within urban policies, with a focus on Italian cities. In particular, the article discusses data collected from representatives of 100 municipalities across Northern, Central and Southern Italy. Moreover, it addresses the types of policies and initiatives adopted at the local level, the main obstacles encountered, the role of national and international city networks and the impact of Covid-19 on urban food security, with the aim to identify potential models of urban food policies as a structural component of a broader urban agenda. By doing this, the article aims at filling a research gap in current literature, as it is the first large-scale survey on urban food policies in Italy, identifying models of urban food policies that are already being developed within broader urban development agendas. © 2023},

  abstract               = {The beer distribution game is a role-playing board game that also helps people learn about the importance of supply chain management. However, the game does not include the major difficulties in managing food and beverages supply chains. Food and beverages are assigned expiration or best-before date. If these goods cannot be sold within the period of the expiration or best-before date, they are wasted. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to extend the beer distribution game for incorporating these issues and to investigate the effects of the issues with playing the refined game. So, we set a time limit for products in the beer distribution game and include a rule that the products will be considered wasted after the time limit. We subsequently examined the effect of the time limit on food supply chain management. As a result of a preliminary game experiment, we find that the back order is highest at the distributors. Stock is the largest at the factory. Wholesalers and factories cause excessive waste. If the expiration date has passed, delivery is not possible, and the items will therefore be wasted. Furthermore, items will not reach the end consumer. In addition, higher inventory and waste are generated upstream. This result reflects the actual situation in the real world food and beverage industry. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract               = {The accurate operation of a Food Supply Chain (FSC) is a critical issue as it directly interfaces with health and safety matters. This study addresses coordination and conflict management in a three-level FSC that embraces a new inventory type known as growing items like poultry and livestock. The chain involves a rearing farm as the supplier, a processed food producer as the manufacturer, and multiple processed food retailers. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is applied by the manufacturer to handle the retailers' systems and prevent replenishment mismatches and thereby food waste. To increase its market coverage, the manufacturer needs to provide the retailers with enough incentives to enter this setting. So, a cost-sharing contract is designed under which the manufacturer undertakes a fraction of the retailers’ holding costs. Accordingly, the manufacturer faces two contradictory targets, increasing its market coverage by convincing the retailers to enter the system on the one hand and managing its costs efficiently on the other hand. An analytic solution approach with a game-theoretic perspective is developed to solve the model. Extensive numerical experiments and a case study are provided, presenting fruitful managerial insights that can be utilized by the policymakers and chain members under different settings. The results highlight the efficiency of our VMI and cost-sharing collaboration scheme in enhancing the performance of the chain. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the ever-growing popularity of food deliver, more and more consumers are embracing this convenience as part of their lifestyle. However, the issue of food waste created by the food deliver industry has become a pressing concern in society. This paper aims to examine the link between food waste and food delivery services, and investigate the effects of anti-food waste regulations on the generation of food waste and the choice of logistics strategies in an Online-to-Offline (O2O) supply chain. Using game-theoretical approach, we focus on two prominent logistics strategies—the restaurant-free self-logistics strategy (RF strategy) and the platform-charge logistics strategy (PC strategy). Our research results show that anti-food waste regulation can effectively reduce food waste in food delivery service under the PC logistics strategy. The choice of logistics strategy is constrained by the online market potential, the relative logistics costs of platform logistics, and anti-food waste regulations. If the anti-food waste regulation is strict, as long as the size of the food delivery market and the relative logistics costs of platform logistics are not simultaneously small, the RF strategy will be the equilibrium strategy, whereas the supply chain members should choose the PC strategy. The study thus offers useful inferences for theory and practice. Copyright © 2024 Xu, Du and Xu.},

The food service industry is unable to operate normally and faces issues such as frequent leave requests, shortened business hours and reduction in the number of seats in restaurants to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, several restaurants have been forced to close. Therefore, this study proposes a game system that applies the mechanism of the prediction market to solicit ideas from employees for recovery of sales in small restaurants and effective use of ingredients (including reduction of food waste) under the business scenario in COVID-19. In such a game, routine restaurant operations can be understood, current issues can be analyzed and the deductions from these can be used as a reference for subsequent business opportunities. The game will improve communication between owners and employees. Understanding the contents of food waste will be beneficial to employees and consumers. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Food waste is currently a major challenge for the world. It is the precursor to several socioeconomic problems that are plaguing modern society. To counter and to, simultaneously, stand by the undernourished, surplus food redistribution has surfaced as a viable solution. Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-mediated food redistribution is a highly scalable approach and it percolates into the lives of the masses far better. Even if ICT is not brought into the picture, the presence of food surplus redistribution in developing countries such as India is scarce and is limited to only a few of the major cities. The discussion of a surplus food redistribution framework under strategic settings is a less discussed topic around the globe. This paper aims to address a surplus food redistribution framework under strategic settings, thereby facilitating a smoother exchange of surplus food in the smart cities of developing countries and beyond. As ICT is seamlessly available in smart cities, the paper aims to focus the framework in these cities. However, this can be extended beyond the smart cities to places with greater human involvement. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Environmental damage or health concerns related to diet are some alarming consequences of our behaviour in the near future. Consumers can make a difference depending on their eating behaviour and conscientiousness about minimizing environmental damage. One way to make children more aware of the environment and induce them to eat healthier food in the future might be educational games where they could learn the importance of the environment and the effect of the food they eat on their health status. In this study, we investigated parental behaviour when feeding their children and their willingness to pay for a game product with educational and eating functions. The sample consisted of 300 parents of children aged from 4 to 12. A hypothetical choice experiment has been used and a latent class model estimated the parents’ preferences for a plant‐based product game carrying two attributes, namely, the price and narrative context of the game The results indicated that parents were willing to pay more for a product with a storybook related to healthy eating habits or recycling than one with no storybook. Moreover, two dominant feeding styles in households were found: indulgent parents and uninvolved parents. This alternative approach is oriented toward educating people from the early stages of their lives, creating a favourable environment for the development of preferences for healthier food. © 2021 by the authors.

To create an experience that could be playful enough to attract and engage people, while still subtly conveying a serious message, we chose the game of hopscotch as a backdrop for a playful experience, revealing at each step the journey a plastic bottle goes through during its lifecycle. Accordingly, we named the work Rayuela, which is the Spanish word for hopscotch. We built Rayuela as a modular system consisting of 11 light boxes, each telling a different fact about the plastic bottle's journey. Each time people jumped on a box, it turned the next one on, thus progressively revealing the story. As the work was designed for exhibition in a very large public festival lasting about a month, design considerations ranged form aesthetic and interactive aspects to robustness and reliability. In this paper, we describe the conceptual rationale for Rayuela, its design and building process, and the methods for automated data gathering we implemented. We then present the results of the field study, and discuss preliminary findings, as well as implications for future design. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

An anti-food-waste movement by changing the consumption behaviors can only be sustainable when our young generation aware and make a conscious decision to not waste the food and know how to prevent it. The aim of this study is to develop a gamified food waste awareness campaign through the game-based learning activity for the youths. This study uses the five stages of the design thinking (empathy, define, ideation, prototype, and testing) for the development of the gamification of the food waste awareness campaign. This approach enables designers to develop an attractive food waste awareness campaign using the game mechanics, aesthetics, and game thinking. The proposed gamified Food Waste Awareness Campaign has been tested in several junior and high schools in Bandung and can be useful to create the food waste awareness for these students. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Planet Earth is under severe stress from several inter-linked factors mainly associated with rising global population, linear resource consumption, security of resources, unsurmountable waste generation, and social inequality, which unabated will lead to an unsustainable 21st Century. The traditional way products are designed promotes a linear economy that discards recoverable resources and creates negative environmental and social impacts. Here, we suggest multi-disciplinary approaches encompassing chemistry, process engineering and sustainability science, and sustainable solutions in "game changer" challenges in three intersecting arenas of food: Sustainable diet, valorisation of unavoidable food supply chain wastes, and circularity of food value chain systems aligning with the United Nations' seventeen Sustainable Development Goals. In the arena of sustainable diet, comprehensive life cycle assessment using the global life cycle inventory datasets and recommended daily servings is conducted to rank food choices, covering all food groups from fresh fruits/vegetables, lentils/pulses and grains to livestock, with regard to health and the environment, to emphasise the essence of plant-based diet, especially plant-based sources of protein, for holistic systemic sustainability and stability of the earth system. In the arena of unavoidable food supply chain wastes, economically feasible and synergistically (energy and material) integrated innovative biorefinery systems are suggested to transform unavoidable food waste into functional and platform chemical productions alongside energy vectors: Fuel or combined heat and power generation. In the arena of circularity of food value chain systems, novel materials and methods for plant-based protein functionalisation for food/nutraceutical applications are investigated using regenerative bio-surfactants from unavoidable food waste. This circular economy or industrial symbiosis example thus combines the other two arenas, i.e., plant-based protein sourcing and unavoidable food waste valorisation. The multi-disciplinary analysis here will eventually impact on policies for dietary change, but also contribute knowledge needed by industry and policy makers and raise awareness amongst the population at large for making a better approach to the circular economy of food. © 2020 by the authors.},

In this study, we propose an equilibrium search technique that is based on genetic algorithm and introduced the concept of replicator dynamics, wherein strategies with a higher payoff are more likely to be employed in the next generation. Using the proposed method, the calculation time for a game that models an auction of products was reduced by 46%. Additionally, the effects of the selling time limit for manufacturers and supermarkets, one of the business practices, on the food (milk) supply chain were examined. Under the conditions implemented in our study, the relaxation of such limits reduced food loss and waste without harming the profits of stakeholders in the supply chain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Most of product waste is due to label problems and handling errors, some retailers try to use blockchain-based system to tackle food waste. However, blockchain adoption requires the participation of all supply chain members (e.g. suppliers and logistics service providers) while their incentives remain unclear. Considering a multi-tier system comprising a supplier, a retailer and a logistic service provider, we solve a multi-stage optimisation problem when the products stored in advance are subject to shelf-life due date risk while the real-time order is subject to upstream responsive pricing threat. We evaluate the effectiveness of product tracking system based on blockchain applications. Both real-data validation and game theoretic analysis reveal the stakeholder’s participation incentive conflicts and the dark side of triple-marginalization. However, a sequential co-opetition mechanism is capable of coordinating the stakeholders’ preferences for the product tracking system. We further find that saving waste and balancing the advanced and real-time orders do not necessarily indicate improvement of environmental sustainability. We suggest that: Retailers should carefully judge the product tracking system because of the potential lose-lose situation for profitability and sustainability. But once retailers can profit from blockchain adoption, suppliers are likely to profit from joining the blockchain. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract               = {Backyard poultry producers have been associated with outbreaks of exotic (e.g. avian influenza) and endemic (e.g. Salmonella) disease all over the world. Currently in the UK the registration of small flocks (less than 50 birds) with local authorities is voluntary therefore there is not an accurate record of how many keepers and birds there are or where they are located. This lack of information (e.g. how many birds they keep, what type of birds, biosecurity measures they implement, etc.) may compromise contingency planning in an outbreak. A questionnaire was designed and implemented to gather information that will allow some of the knowledge gaps to be filled. The questionnaire comprised a total of 63 questions divided into seven sections (characterisation of the keeper, location of the enterprise and interest in poultry, poultry husbandry, transport of poultry, details about the poultry enterprise, marketing of poultry products, and poultry health/biosecurity). The questionnaire was implemented through an online survey, which was promoted through web links in smallholders’ websites, Facebook pages, the SRUC network, a course about poultry welfare, and leaflets at smallholders’ festivals. The survey was open from 24th October 2016 to 10th April 2017 and 176 questionnaires were completed by target respondents. Overall, our results suggest that the level of disease identified by backyard poultry keepers is low but the majority of the backyard poultry keepers also keep other livestock species, with an associated increased risk for disease transmission between species. Almost all respondents reported implementing at least one biosecurity measure, although in the majority of cases the measures taken were not comprehensive. A lack of knowledge about the legislation concerning poultry-keeping activities was evidenced by the answers given to some questions, such as the feeding of kitchen scraps and how to dispose of dead stocks. This investigation fills gaps in knowledge which will allow industry stakeholders and policy makers to adapt their current disease programmes and contingency plans to the reality of the health and biosecurity status of backyard poultry. It also highlights that government could play a more active role in engaging with backyard poultry keepers and in finding ways to disseminate reliable information generally and about disease outbreaks specifically, to these keepers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Obesity-driven nutrition education in schools does not appear to result in healthier adolescent food choices. This study explored food systems as an alternative pedagogical approach to engage students in nutrition education. METHODS: After playing a food systems computer game, 250 13- to 16-year-old students in 5 Western Australian secondary schools, participated in group discussions to distinguish learning and interests in food systems. Discussion records were thematically coded using constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Students reported crop growth, food production and food waste, healthier food choices, and food systems as knowledge outcomes of game play. They requested additional content on food production, costing, handling, processing, and accessing local produce. Experiential activities were preferred pedagogical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-curricular pedagogy which embraces human and planetary health through a food systems lens, can engage adolescents in nutrition education. Transformational computer games are effective to engage, educate and stimulate inquiry in food systems education. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract               = {Insect-based food and feed have received a lot of attention recently. The EU Farm-to-Fork Strategy, for example, mentions insects as an alternative feed material that could reduce the environmental and climate impact of livestock production. Insects are an interesting source of feed because of their ability to convert many types of organic material into protein and fat, including food products that currently go to waste. Having an insect industry producing protein meal from recycled food waste would contribute towards more sustainable agricultural and aquaculture sectors. However, there are many questions associated with this development which we cannot answer at this point. For instance, how much food waste is actually available at the European and global levels for insect-based protein meal production? If we used the available food waste for insect meal production, what would be the consequences for the agricultural markets and how would it affect the agricultural GHG emission budget? In this article we show that there is a considerable amount of food waste that could be used for insect meal production; which would have substantial impacts on agricultural markets – particularly in the case where there was some relaxation of regulations. According to our calculations, agricultural greenhouse gas emissions would only be modestly affected. © 2022 The Authors.

  abstract            = {The local environment can be explored to sustain effective sustainability learning. With this aim, new learning methodologies can be fostered, namely mobile and game-based learning, as is the case of the EduPARK app. This app supports innovative learning strategies through treasure hunt games, integrating multimedia and augmented reality resources, in natural spaces. This paper presents a pilot case study of a pedagogical approach based on the exploration of a game in the EduPARK app, in the outdoors. The game was developed to be explored in the largest annual event of the University of Aveiro (UA) – XPERiMENTA 2022 – where students of several ages and the wider community are invited to participate in diverse activities on the campuses. The main goal of the activity “XPERiMENTA with EduPARK in the UA Campus” was to raise basic education students’ awareness towards nature conservation. Eighteen students (14 and 15 years-old) explored an interdisciplinary educational game that encouraged them to follow a path through the UA Campuses to promote learning related to recycling, renewable energies, food waste, and ocean plastic pollution. Simultaneously, curricular contents of Science, Mathematics, Education for Citizenship, and cultural aspects of the city of Aveiro were articulated. At the end of the activity, an individual and anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the activity was applied. Students revealed a positive attitude towards the EduPARK app, as their answers revealed they felt motivated to learn during the game. Additionally, students reached a good performance in the game, although difficulties in one specific question were identified. This paper presents preliminary results that will inform the development of a new related project, the EduCITY, that aims to promote education for sustainability through a smart learning city environment. © 2023 Proceedings of the International Conferences on e-Society 2023, ES 2023 and Mobile Learning 2023, ML 2023.

  abstract            = {Food waste is one of the greatest economic and ethical challenges in the world. Empowering consumers with the ability to assess the quality of fruit can be a game changer for reducing waste and motivating a healthier diet. In this paper, we present Meta-Sticker a novel low-cost non-invasive solution for accurate fruit sensing via a sub-THz metamaterial sticker. The key idea is to exploit fruit as a substrate for resonating meta-atoms. Changes in the chemical composite of the fruit over time (e.g., sugar and water concentration) yield variation in the dielectric properties of the fruit (here substrate). Interestingly, this would affect the resonant frequency of the Meta-Sticker. We design Meta-Sticker to resonate in the sub-THz bands for their sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the inner pulp of the fruit. We develop a model that translates the resonance of Meta-Sticker to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We fabricate Meta-Sticker on paper and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments. We demonstrate that our system can estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruits with an average Normalized RMSE value of 1.24%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceptible by the consumer. Our design is non-invasive, low-cost (less than a cent), passive, biodegradable, and conformal. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

	abstract = {Consumers are responsible for almost 50 percent of food waste. Consumer-focused interventions are crucial to achieve many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 12.3. There are many factors that cause food waste, and these can be prevented by changing the consumption behavior of adults. Mobile apps are seen as promising tools to change consumer behavior for ensuring more sustainable food consumption. This study describes the development process and examines the perceived quality of MySusCof, an app intended to reduce the food waste of consumers. The uMARS scale was used for collecting data from consumers. Within the scope of the study, two studies were conducted to examine the development process of the application and to determine the user reactions to the mobile application. Results show that gamification elements with hedonic and social components, as well as functional aspects, are important features for user engagement and perceived impact. The qualitative results also supported the user experience in both hedonic and functional value and role of mobile apps to lead behavior change. This study serves as a guideline for future developers of mobile apps intended to lead consumers to a more sustainable food consumption. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract            = {Consumer food waste in industrialised countries is becoming an increasing concern as its impact on greenhouse emissions is comparable to that of the aviation industry. In recent years we have accordingly seen a growing interest in HCI to support users getting into more sustainable consumption practices. As part of this movement, we present in this paper a serious game called Face-The-Waste that is meant to increase users food literacy and educate them about the impact and development of food waste. Our serious game comes in the form of a public installation that uses provocative design to engage the users. They had to answer multiple choice questions and if they answered wrongly real food would be disposed into a bin in front of the users eyes. The aim with this was to create a strong emotional response and increase the level of reflection on the topic. In our evaluation we not only found that the users often voiced very strong emotional reactions but also engaged and discussed the question and their content. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such provocations can add a new layer for the design of serious games.  © 2021 ACM.},

In this chapter, we report and critically discuss the findings from earlier and recent studies dealing with food context and its effect on children's (age 3-18years) food perception, liking, and selection, with a specific and in-depth analysis of the following factors: the meal (i.e., portion and container size, food variety, appropriateness of eating occasion); the physical environment (i.e., laboratory vs. realistic settings); and the social environment (i.e., social influence and modeling). Attention is also devoted to the analysis of age- and gender-related differences in the effect of contextual factors on children's eating behavior. Studying the contextual factors related to food consumption among children could provide a deeper understanding of their thoughts and expectations about food and food settings, and could help in finding solutions to increase the acceptance of target products (e.g., fruits and vegetables), thus contributing to improvement of children's health, and to reducing food waste, which is a critical issue, especially in institutional contexts, such as school. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract               = {Dogs (Canis familiaris) are ubiquitous in human settlements. A range of studies suggests that uses of dogs vary with ecological context. High seasonality and reliance upon large game appears to favor investments in the uses of dogs as aids in hunting and hauling. Regional cultural traditions may also play significant roles in attitudes and behaviors towards dogs. We use ethnographic and archaeological data to assess six hypotheses concerning the roles of dogs in the traditional villages on the Mid-Fraser Canyon in British Columbia. We find that it is likely that village dogs lived in traditional Mid-Fraser villages where they may have consumed human food waste, but were also used for hunting, possibly hauling loads, as a source of products, and as a target of ritual treatments. Given their importance in numerous activities, dogs may have been wealth items for select households. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract            = {Introduction: Worldwide, childhood obesity puts children at risk for co-morbidities and early death. Despite innovative interventions to enhance healthy nutritional choices, effective, sustainable outcomes are lacking, and unhealthy behaviors persist. Gamification shows promise in increasing child engagement, motivation and learning, while minimizing teacher burden. With child input, we designed an interactive digital game focused on basic nutrition knowledge for children to foster healthy nutrition choices. Our purpose is to describe the process, challenges, and lessons learned while designing MountainQuest, a multi-level, action/adventure, digital game engaging school-age children in decision-making through a game narrative incorporating mechanics. Method: Four design, implementation, and playtesting/user iterations were completed to assure acceptability, feasibility, and rigor of MountainQuest: 0.0) preliminary design; 1.0) initial prototyping with 2D platformer; 2.0) 3D platformer; and 3.0) 3D redesign. At least five SA children (8-14 years old) played each version for 3-5 days and provided feedback through semi-structured interviews. Affinity diagram analysis was used and informed each iteration. Inter-rater agreement on common themes was ≥ 70%. Results: Common themes were mapped into two prioritized lists: issues/bugs and game features wish list. For iteration 0.0, children collaborated with the research team to develop the game narrative and characters. Iteration 1.0 was evaluated as too “simplistic,” “short,” preachy,” and “cartoonish.” Iteration 2.0 had scenes deemed too long with difficult mechanics, and disruptive food management scenes; suggestions included incorporating more exploration and mazes. Iteration 3.0 yielded a game where school-age children manage food inventories influencing hunger, thirst, and energy metrics to successfully navigate a mountain, defeat trolls, and save a village. Conclusion: The children's input was direct, precise, and challenged the game designers. Inclusion of children as direct informants guided the development of MountainQuest into an engaging, interactive, and educational game to enhance healthy nutritional choices, preparing it for an experimental trial. © The Authors, 2021.

  abstract            = {Black products constitute about 15% of the domestic plastic waste stream, of which the majority is single-use packaging and trays for food. This material is not, however, readily recycled owing to the low sensitivity of black pigments to near infrared radiation used in conventional plastic sorting facilities. Accordingly, there is mounting evidence that the demand for black plastics in consumer products is partly met by sourcing material from the plastic housings of end-of-life waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE). Inefficiently sorted WEEE plastic has the potential to introduce restricted and hazardous substances into the recyclate, including brominated flame retardants (BFRs), Sb, a flame retardant synergist, and the heavy metals, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb. The current paper examines the life cycles of single-use black food packaging and black plastic WEEE in the context of current international regulations and directives and best practices for sorting, disposal and recycling. The discussion is supported by published and unpublished measurements of restricted substances (including Br as a proxy for BFRs) in food packaging, EEE plastic goods and non-EEE plastic products. Specifically, measurements confirm the linear economy of plastic food packaging and demonstrate a complex quasi-circular economy for WEEE plastic that results in significant and widespread contamination of black consumer goods ranging from thermos cups and cutlery to tool handles and grips, and from toys and games to spectacle frames and jewellery. The environmental impacts and human exposure routes arising from WEEE plastic recycling and contamination of consumer goods are described, including those associated with marine pollution. Regarding the latter, a compilation of elemental data on black plastic litter collected from beaches of southwest England reveals a similar chemical signature to that of contaminated consumer goods and blended plastic WEEE recyclate, exemplifying the pervasiveness of the problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},
