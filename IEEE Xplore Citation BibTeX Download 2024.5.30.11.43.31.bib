  abstract={Food waste has been a major challenge in recent decades, with up to 1.3 trillion tonnes of food waste produced annually. With the advent of modern technologies and apps such as Exspiro, which make it easier to manage food in the home, there is an opportunity to reduce this unnecessary food waste. The app offers, among other things, several functionalities that are designed to lead to sustainability - notifying the user of the impending consumption of food, recipes with such food, and also a statistical module that informs the user what food is wasted the most in the household.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Gamification refers to the application of gaming concepts in non-playful contexts to encourage engagement with a product or service. Gameful systems are software programs that embed this concept and are increasingly being applied in various fields, such as environmental awareness, education and training, health, and food waste reduction. These systems are based on a set of rules defined by game designers, who specify the conditions that must be met to evolve the state of a game and the associated consequences. However, the current approaches to defining rules in gameful systems carry certain limitations that can give rise to undesirable or unforeseen behaviors. These limitations pose significant challenges to the smooth functioning and overall effectiveness of gameful experiences. This paper presents a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed to simplify and strengthen the entire rule lifecycle process. The DSL guides designers during the rule definition process using easy-to-use fluent APIs. Additionally, it enables the simulation of rules and verification of their behavior through a graph that explicitly shows their interconnection. Finally, the DSL facilitates the deployment of rules on the gamification engine with simple steps. This approach enhances the effectiveness of gameful systems by reducing the likelihood of unintended consequences and improving the overall user experience.},

  abstract={Food waste has become a major global concern. In order to effectively reduce food waste, users need to cultivate the habit of saving food. It analyzes the reasons why users waste food from the behavioral level, and proposes a food-saving interactive design strategy based on the FBM behavior model. By analyzing the current situation of food waste in the target group and users' attitudes, behaviors, and psychology towards food waste, combined with questionnaires, interviews, etc., quantitative and qualitative analysis are carried out, and the user's food waste links in catering and different scenarios are summarized. The amount of food wastage and the problems caused by food waste. Combining the FBM behavior model, an interactive design method for cultivating food-saving habits is proposed from three aspects: enhancing user motivation, improving user capabilities, and increasing trigger mechanisms. Interactive design methods such as immersive experience, timely and effective feedback, interesting game interactions, incentive mechanisms, and diversified choices can effectively promote users' understanding of food sources, growth and other knowledge, and cultivate knowledge in an interesting form, so that users can personally experience the hard-won food in the bowl, and then cultivate the user's sense of responsibility and mission to save food, and finally develop a good habit of saving food.},

  abstract={Healthcare is the most pivotal domain of every nation. With the sudden upraise of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a major concern for the healthcare industry to provide quality medical services to the common people. Vulnerable healthcare conditions have proven to be fatal for the patients. Conspicuously, it has become indispensable to assess the quality of healthcare services provided by the hospitals. The current article focuses on analyzing healthcare service quality delivered by the hospitals and healthcare centers. Specifically, the presented framework utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to acquire real-time ambient data inside smart hospitals. The quantification of the healthcare service is performed using the Probability of Health Grade (PoHG) to classify data segments using the probabilistic Bayesian belief model. Furthermore, the temporal data abstraction is performed for the numerical analysis of healthcare service quality in terms of the health quality index (HQI). Finally, a 2-player game theory-inspired decision modeling is performed to analyze healthcare quality in a time-sensitive manner. The proposed framework is assessed using a simulated environment where 225325 data segments are analyzed. Results are compared with state-of-the-art techniques in which enhanced performance measures are registered in terms of classification efficacy (93.74%), decision-making efficiency [coefficient of determination (95%), accuracy (97.53%), mean square error (2.01%), and root mean square error (1.95%)], temporal delay (96.62 s), and reliability (91.58%).},

  abstract={Nutritional food is the most important aspect for people to fulfil their daily needs, but nowadays, the change of lifestyle can affect the style of food consumption, for instance leaving food when they take a meal. Besides, food leftover causes loss of consumed nutrients. We took an observation in a canteen in Faculty of Agricultural Technology in University of Brawijaya produces lost of food about 1,142.5 gram per day. To prevent the amount of food waste, this paper proposes an early stage framework to create an automatic leftover estimation method using image segmentation based on color channel. So that, we can optimize of the amount of food served and avoid loss food nutritions hereinafter. We experimented in two types of background of tray box: black and gray, then an automatic cropping process based on each sub area of tray box is implemented. Each part of them contains an item of food, so we detect the area using color channel segmentation and implements B component in LAB color space. After getting the main area of food, then two areas between segmented food image are compared before and after being consumed. The calculation of the predicted leftover portion is calculated based on original weight of food item. The result shows that tray box with black background with constant (cd) is the best to project leftover, in which reaches 2.37 of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It proves that the propose method is sufficient to handle the leftover prediction of food.},

  year={2018},

  abstract={Hands are primary vectors of many communicable diseases because they come in contact with a variety of surfaces and fluids. Acute diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory diseases can be prevented by washing hands at appropriate times. This habit is essential for households of urban low-income groups since their surroundings are a hotbed for pathogens. The effect of hand washing is also acknowledged by experts and the world health organisation (WHO). We propose a design based intervention employing behaviour change principles suitable for such households. The goal of the intervention was to nudge people to wash hands at appropriate times via self reflection. Our intervention induces self reflection through reminders and channel factors. We measured hand washing frequency to evaluate the change in behavior, and further investigated this habit through interviews. Results of our study indicate that channel factors bring significant change in hand washing behaviour than reminders.},

  abstract={With the growing numbers of Augmented (AR) education applications and the increasing pervasiveness of object recognition. It is important to understand how these technologies benefit students in labor education. In this paper, we explore student's experience in terms of knowledge gain and learning motivation when learning through a combination of AR and object recognition technologies. We experimented to investigate how effective the combination of AR and object recognition was in the learning of garbage sorting knowledge. We found encouraging results by creating a novel teaching strategy using these two technologies, not only in terms of increase in knowledge gain and learning motivation when compared with traditional strategy but also enabling students to have a better acceptance of technologies.},

  abstract={Software engineering (SE) educators are challenged to balance the scope and depth in their courses to train students in skills which will fulfill the ever-evolving industry needs. Capstone courses are a tool for educators to transfer hands-on experience into practical knowledge and skills of SE students. This paper describes the design of a Casptone course, at Lappeenranta University of Technology. The designed course is "human-centric SE capstone", infusing design thinking methods and agile practices into the project life-cycle knowhow. The capstone was offered in spring of 2017 as a 16-week course for 29 students. Design thinking was effective to perform requirement elicitation, software design and testing. Also, the applied approach allowed students to be self-directed which increased their motivation, as a result there was zero dropout rate. Design thinking is a powerful mean of problem solving and effectively supports SE education in bringing a more hands-on and minds-on, problem-based curriculum.},
