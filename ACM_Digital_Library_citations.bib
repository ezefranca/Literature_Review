abstract = {The fields of Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction have traditionally evolved in parallel, with little cross-pollination, both in industry and academia. However, effectively delivering software products offering superior user experiences requires a tight collaboration between professionals from both fields. In recent years, some approaches combining the two perspectives have been proposed in industry, including dual-track agile software development. Yet, very few courses cover those integrated approaches in academia, and it appears that no publication so far has reported the existence of a scholarly course covering dual-track agile. This paper introduces a course that addresses the divide between Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction through an integrated approach to requirements engineering and interaction design, in the context of dual-track agile. The course design combines traditional and flipped-classroom delivery, together with project-based learning. During the course project, students learn to design and implement software systems that address real problems and satisfy real stakeholders' needs by being useful, usable, and enjoyable to use. This paper documents the author's experience designing and teaching the course over the past four years. It aims to convince, inspire, and enable others to teach similar courses, bringing interaction design to the forefront of agile software development.},

abstract = {In this paper we present Videos of Things: videos that portray the mediated, lived world of computational artifacts informed by postphenomenology. In a post-phenomenological understanding, things and us are interdependent in that they mutually shape each other. And as a whole, technology or designed things mediate the relations between our world and us. This can be a challenge for designers. Through the making of design videos, we explored narrative strategies for creating stories featuring technological mediation. These include humanness, patterns in time, and non-human ensembles. We reflect on how the videos at different stages of the design process have helped to a) speculate on technological mediated relationships, b) synthesize and reflect on qualitative data on technological mediation and c) anticipate technological mediation. The paper contributes different narrative strategies for design videos and the role these videos can play within a design process aimed at elaborating the mediated qualities of technologies.},

abstract = {In recent years, Human Food Interaction (HFI) as a field of research has gained currency within HCI with a focus on how we grow, shop, cook and eat food using digital technologies. Advances in food printing technologies add an extra dimension to these established practices. Research is needed to understand how food printing technologies may affect our practices and relationship with food. This SIG meeting is structured to give HCI researchers an overview of current food printing practices and to discuss grand challenges associated with digital food. Our aims are to develop a stronger community surrounding digital food technology and Human Food Interaction (HFI) and help to move these fields forward via timely discussion and the sharing of successes and challenges. Participants will also engage in playful activities around food and will have an opportunity to create and taste 3D printed chocolates, helping them learn and debate the opportunities that exist with digitally printed food.},

When developing a gamified chatbot system, there are factors related to user types (ages, gender and others) that we should consider to effectively integrate the game elements into the chatbot while targeting the right audience. In this study, we discuss the development of an educational chatbot game 'CiboPoli', that's specialised in teaching children about healthy lifestyle through an interactive social game environment. The presented game is based on a paper prototype that we developed to teach primary school students about healthy diet and food waste management. The current approach will be more engaging and pose AI capabilities. This is still a work in progress and we plan to improve its design by incorporating additional components, such as dialog management module, user-specific knowledge module or machine learning module. Future work will be devoted to integrating machine learning to automatically identify learners emotions and provide personalised suggestions. Moreover, we tested the initial prototype with school students and found that it outperforms the paper version. Future work will focus on applying it to other domains and demographics.},

We sense eating actions of players by analyzing chewing sounds captured by a low-cost microphone attached to the players cheek. Our interest in using cooperative eating as a way of interacting in virtual reality is driven by the possibilities of creating a cross-modal gameplay experience that benefits social interactions. A user study with 22 players showed that eating real food improved players feeling of presence, challenged trust dependencies and made the survival aspect of the game feel more "real". We use these insights to articulate three design themes that can guide designers in creating virtual reality games that incorporate cooperative eating. Ultimately, our work aims to guide design thinking towards using underexplored interaction methods in virtual reality games, thereby reiterating the post-digital design theme of TEI 2018.},

abstract = {Novices learn innovation best through project-based learning (PBL), working in face-to-face teams to tackle real-world problems. Yet, real-world projects are complex, stressful, and especially challenging for novices. Online communities could provide social support to motivate novices, but it is unclear how to design online communities to support face-to-face PBL teams. Here we ask: How might we design an online system that enlists external supporters to provide online social support to motivate PBL students? Our need-finding study found that PBL students received infrequent social support, rarely engaged in help-seeking, and perceived little progress until the end of their projects. Based on these findings, we designed CheerOn, an online social support system that prompts novice student teams to externalize progress allowing external, online supporters to offer social support. We tested CheerOn with 3 PBL teams and 15 external supporters over a 6-week course. We found that external supporters provided instrumental, informational, and emotional support that strengthened students’ bonds to the community, which increased help-seeking. Supporters also provided appraisal support, which increased students’ perceived value of their work. Supporters were more likely to offer informational and instrumental support when they were promoted or saw a clear need for help; supporters who received gratitude from students were more likely to offer emotional support in return; and supporters who were closely connected to the community were more likely to offer appraisal and instrumental support. Theoretically, this research contributes to our understanding of how hybrid face-to-face and online communities can impact the behavior of PBL students, specifically towards the facilitation of help-seeking behavior, as well as increased understanding of how different types of social support (i.e., appraisal, emotional, informational, and instrumental) can impact the participation of PBL students and supporters. Practically, this research contributes to our understanding of how to design socio-technical systems that facilitate social support for offline novice PBL students working, expanding the instructional resources available for preparing novices in PBL environments.},

However, research about what sorts of reflection, if any, players experience, or what benefits they might derive from it, is scarce. We report on an interview study that explored when instances of reflection occurred, at what level players reflected on their gaming experience, as well as their reactions. Our findings revealed that many players considered reflection to be a worthwhile activity in itself, highlighting its significance for the player experience beyond moment-to-moment gameplay. However, while players engaged in reflective description and dialogic reflection, we observed little to no instances of higher-level transformative and critical reflection. We conclude with a discussion of the value and challenges inherent to evaluating reflection on games.},

The food we consume be it a fruit picked from a tree or an elaborate restaurant dish is full of play opportunities and recent technological advances such as miniaturized electronics and fabrication techniques have opened up a host of new potentials for play and interaction. In this paper we examine the relationship between food and play, what it means to play with your food? What are the materialities of taste and flavour in a world in which the physical and the digital are deeply intertwined and in which the senses can easily be fooled by virtual means? And what modalities of play are possible with food, drink and flavor sensations?},

abstract = {The underrepresentation within computer science of women, domestic students of color, and students with lower socioeconomic-status remains a national issue. Recent studies demonstrate two critical factors: Persistent stereotypes about "who does computer science" can preclude interest in the field for members of these groups; many also perceive computing as "irrelevant" and "asocial". While these issues must be addressed at multiple ages and levels, many suggest that we should start early, before students have developed stereotypes. As a step in combating (mis-)perceptions of ability and relevance, we developed and conducted a spectrum of week-long summer "code camps" for regional middle-school students. These camps emphasize meaningful uses of computing, on building self-efficacy, and on broadening understanding of who does and can do computer science. In this paper, we focus on our "data science for social good" (ds4sg) camp, in which students explored computational approaches to data science through a lens of computing for social good, discovering how computing helps them not only better understand societal issues but also convince others to address problems. We discuss the rationale for the curriculum and its content, including our uses of pair programming, personal projects, and a growth model that brings students from block-based programming to professional Jupyter data notebooks. We consider the short-term effects the camps have on students' self-efficacy and perceptions of computer science. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for those intending to offer similar camps.},

abstract = {Recent sustainable HCI research has advocated "working with nature" as a potentially efficacious alternative to human efforts to control it: yet it is less clear how to do so. We contribute to the theoretical aspect of this research by presenting an ethnographic study on alternative farming practices, in which the farm is not so much a system but an assemblage characterized by multiple systems or rationalities always evolving and changing. In them, relationships among species alternate between mutually beneficial in one moment (or season), and harmful in the next. If HCI is to participate in and to support working with nature, we believe that it will have to situate itself within such assemblages and temporalities. In this work, we look into nontraditional users (e.g., nonhumans) and emerging forms of uses (e.g., interactions between human and other species) to help open a design space for technological interventions. We offer three ethnographic accounts in which farmers-and ourselves as researchers-learn to notice, respond, and engage in symbiotic encounters with companion species and the living soil itself.},

abstract = {Ten years ago, Thaler and Sunstein introduced the notion of nudging to talk about how subtle changes in the 'choice architecture' can alter people's behaviors in predictable ways. This idea was eagerly adopted in HCI and applied in multiple contexts, including health, sustainability and privacy. Despite this, we still lack an understanding of how to design effective technology-mediated nudges. In this paper we present a systematic review of the use of nudging in HCI research with the goal of laying out the design space of technology-mediated nudging - the why (i.e., which cognitive biases do nudges combat) and the how (i.e., what exact mechanisms do nudges employ to incur behavior change). All in all, we found 23 distinct mechanisms of nudging, grouped in 6 categories, and leveraging 15 different cognitive biases. We present these as a framework for technology-mediated nudging, and discuss the factors shaping nudges' effectiveness and their ethical implications.},

Based on the premise that such automation is difficult due to the contingent nature of people's practices, in this work we explore the nature of these contingencies in depth. We have designed and conducted a technology probe that made use of simple linear predictions as a provocation, and invited people to track the life of their household essentials over a two-month period. Through a mixed-method approach we demonstrate the challenges of simple predictions, and in turn identify eight categories of contingencies that influenced prediction accuracy. We discuss strategies for how designers of future predictive IoT systems may take the contingencies into account by removing, hiding, revealing, managing, or exploiting the system uncertainty at the core of the issue.},

The tool allows researchers to engage in new ways with the HFI literature, propose modifications and additions to the review, and thereby actively engage in community-making. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we characterize the state of HFI, reporting trends, challenges and opportunities; (2) we provide a taxonomy and tool for diffractive reading of the literature; and (3) we offer our approach for adaptation by research fields facing similar challenges, positing value of the tool and approach beyond HFI.},

abstract = {As the IoT is taking hold in the home, in healthcare, factories, and industry, new challenges and approaches arise for HCI research and design. For example, HCI is exploring agency delegation and automation to support the user in managing the deluge of IoT data, make decisions, or even take actions on behalf of the user, while economic models are being proposed to drive sharing economy services. This creates new problems including how to design appropriate solutions for uncertain and dynamic human behaviour, how to ensure resources are distributed fairly, and how to ensure that the user can understand system actions and ultimately remains in control. These issues are becoming more pertinent as the IoT diversifies into safety-critical domains such as manufacturing and healthcare. This one-day workshop intends to bring together the CHI community to explore the interactional, socio-cultural, ethical, and practical challenges and approaches that these new domains raise for the IoT. With this, we want to consider how such approaches could be integrated to achieve more sustainable, inclusive, or effective interactions.},

abstract = {In contemporary design research and practice, food is often seen as a problem to be fixed. Designers in the corporate startup realm as well as in academic HFI (Human-Food Interaction) have proposed various techno-solutions to curb complex food system issues such as malnutrition and environmental unsustainability. Quantified diet trackers, 'smart' kitchenware, food sharing apps and similar digital food technologies present opportunities for efficient food practices but also challenges to human-food relationship and social food traditions. The Parlour of Futures project reflects on these contradictions and addresses the growing trend of food-technology innovation through the lens of Speculative and Critical Design (SCD). The project takes the form of a traditional Tarot parlour where participants explore possible food-tech futures as prophecies. Through a bespoke Food Tarot cards deck presenting speculative food practices such as Monsanta[n]ism, Gut Gardening, or Turing Foodism, the project provokes playful food-tech imaginaries and future food scenarios. We discuss the opportunities of SCD in nurturing reflective food design and research, and invite OzCHI attendees to contribute their future food ideas during the Parlour demo session.},

To support our review, we offer a conceptual model of Playful HFI informed by: (i) the 34 publications in our dataset; (ii) theories of play, games and HFI; and (iii) previous reviews of play-related HCI. Our conceptual model and review characterise the current state of Playful HFI, highlight resemblances and differences with the broader field of HFI as a whole and surface challenges and opportunities in this new and exciting design space. Our contribution will help HFI scholars to explore new and increasingly playful avenues for the future of food technology and will empower the HFI community to better position (and critically reflect on) future research at the intersection of play, technology and food.},

abstract = {There is an increasing trend that explores the convergence of digital play and eating to support a playful relationship with food. We note that interactive sound, although prevalent in digital game design, has only received limited attention in this trend. To contribute to an understanding of "playful gustosonic experiences", we present a design and study of a novel capacitive-sensing ice cream cone, "iScream!". In a study with 32 participants, the cone played four different sounds (a roaring, crunchy, giggling, and burping sound in order to explore fantasy facilitation, food congruency, anthropomorphism and bodily response) when eating ice cream. The results are two themes derived from six findings each, which detail how players explored the different auditory interaction possibilities with their eating actions while the sounds in turn modified those eating actions. Based on these findings, we present four design tactics for designers aiming to create playful gustosonic experiences to ultimately facilitate a more playful relationship with food.},

The Peekaboo cam is an observational research camera with a coverable lens. We validate in a field study in two homes for 14 days. The resulting photo streams provide qualitative insights on Everyday things in transition. We suggest four design guidelines for observational artifacts for home ecologies.},

Therefore, we argue for a broader perspective on studying the role(s) of digital media supporting people in their transition towards more sustainable food consumption. To understand such roles, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 9 vegans. Our findings highlight an intensive use of (digital) media, especially in the early phase of changing consumption practices. Instead of gamification or persuasive design, media triggers initial irritation, provides information to develop a vegan-specific consumption knowledge and connects like-minded people.},

While mobile technology provides constant connectivity to a world outside the home, it inevitably disrupts family dynamics and the social notion of being together. In this paper, we explore "non-use" of mobile technology in a family setting. To do this, we designed the Pup-Lock provotype, a design provocation intended to challenge established expectations and practices around mobile device use at home. We report on a five-week in-depth study of using Pup-Lock with three families reflecting on their mobile device usage and their experience of non-use. Our findings illustrate how mobile use shapes social expectations and how over-use creates tensions in families. We contribute by showing how provoking non-use through design results in desirable and meaningful ways to increase family interaction. We discuss implications of designing for non-use to challenge established domestic practices around technology use.},

How can we design these algorithms to balance varying interests in a moral, legitimate way? As one answer to this question, we present WeBuildAI, a collective participatory framework that enables people to build algorithmic policy for their communities. The key idea of the framework is to enable stakeholders to construct a computational model that represents their views and to have those models vote on their behalf to create algorithmic policy. As a case study, we applied this framework to a matching algorithm that operates an on-demand food donation transportation service in order to adjudicate equity and efficiency trade-offs. The service's stakeholders--donors, volunteers, recipient organizations, and nonprofit employees--used the framework to design the algorithm through a series of studies in which we researched their experiences. Our findings suggest that the framework successfully enabled participants to build models that they felt confident represented their own beliefs. Participatory algorithm design also improved both procedural fairness and the distributive outcomes of the algorithm, raised participants' algorithmic awareness, and helped identify inconsistencies in human decision-making in the governing organization. Our work demonstrates the feasibility, potential and challenges of community involvement in algorithm design.},

Based on the review, we present opportunities for future research to 1) design for specific user groups, including older adults; 2) connect gardeners to the world from their gardens (i.e., technologies for gardeners to share their discoveries with the world); and to 3) explore activities beyond gardening, e.g., playing, relaxing, admiring nature and citizen science.},

Even though people report being concerned about their privacy online, they often do not take steps to protect it. This is known as the 'privacy paradox' in the literature. In this work we study two well-known strategies based on theories from the behavioral sciences, nudging and boosting, which encourage users to browse in a way that their private data are less exposed. First, an online survey (N=127) tested the comprehensibility and efficacy of various facts (boosts), before the most effective of these were evaluated against 'nudge' interventions previously shown to be efficacious in lab-studies. A three week naturalistic study (N=68) using a browser extension revealed that both nudges and boosts improve browsing privacy, as approximated by different measures. Boosts are also shown to improve user knowledge about privacy in the short term, but the benefit weakens over time.},

We simulated the dining environment to evaluate these dining experiences. We present findings related to both dining play interactions and edible visualizations. To guide future technological development around food related issues, we discuss the implications of our work around three themes: food arrangement, playful discomforts and delayed feedback. Through this work, we aim to advocate and inspire the use of food for designing multi-sensorial serious play.},

abstract = {The HCI community has a rich history of finding new ways to engage people with data beyond the screen. With our work, we aim to expand the scope of how interaction design can engage people, arguing that “eating data” has the potential to allow people to experience “data as delight”. With reference to prior work and our design research findings, we discuss the advantages and the challenges of this approach to integrating data and food. We then identify four themes to guide the design of engagements with data through food: food form, food commensality, food ephemerality, and emotional response to food. Within these design themes, we articulate twelve insights for interaction designers to use when working on serving data as delight.},

abstract = {Since entering the HCI lexicon in the 1990s, Probes have been interpreted and used in divergent ways as a designerly approach to research. While originally positioned as a critique of dominant user-research methods, literature on Probes rarely reflects on such critical dimensions nor explicitly articulates the intents of using Probes as research artifacts. We conducted interviews with 12 design researchers who have worked with Probes within diverse Research through Design projects, exploring direct accounts of how and why Probes are used in practice. Our interviews brought to the fore the critical concerns behind Probe practices in relation to the language of Probing, relationships with participants, and motivations to challenge normative practices. While the pluralistic interpretations of Probes offered by our participants brings challenges, we discuss how making visible the critical motivations of our research opens up new ways of practicing and disseminating Probes.},

abstract = {The relationships that constitute the global industrial food system tend towards two dominant values that are creating unsustainable social and environmental inequalities. The first is a human-centered perspective on food that privileges humans over all other species. The second is a view of food as a commodity to be traded for maximum economic value, rewarding a small number of shareholders. We present work that explores the unique algorithmic affordances of blockchain to create new types of value exchange and governance in the food system. We describe a project that used roleplay with urban agricultural communities to co-design blockchain-based food futures and explore the conditions for creating a thriving multispecies food commons. We discuss how the project helped rethink algorithmic food justice by reconfiguring more-than-human values and reconfiguring food as more-than-human commons. We also discuss some of the challenges and tensions arising from these explorations.},

abstract = {While persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. This criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. We join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. Based on our six-month long ethnography with the Islamic communities in a Bangladeshi city, Kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. Drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how Islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. We further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of CSCW literature in the various domains.},

However, waste sorting has proven to be challenging due to waste complexity and lack of motivation and knowledge among citizens. In particular, waste sorting in public spaces has been found to be difficult. We present a study on waste sorting in public spaces with an automatic waste sorting bin called Waste Wizard. Waste Wizard uses machine learning to classify and sort waste. We deployed it in three public contexts: a zoo, a retail store, and a music festival. Our findings show how practices, knowledge and attitudes influence the complicated process of public waste sorting. Users also displayed playfulness in their interaction and furthermore generated ideas and wishes for public waste sorting. We discuss our findings regarding current work within sustainable HCI and implications for public waste sorting.},

Research in social psychology and behavioral science suggests that social norms interventions, which convey norms shared in the community that people belong in to promote desirable behaviors, can offer a low-cost and scalable approach to encourage actions beyond the courses (ABCs). We tested three social norm interventions that presented a weekly normative message (descriptive, dynamic, or injunctive norm) with aggregate information about course participants' ABCs in the prior week. Randomized experiments in three online courses found effects on ABCs to be weak and moderated by norm message type and the complexity of the target behavior. Although the interventions did not improve course completion, the dynamic norm message was more effective at promoting ABCs for complex behaviors, such as developing environmental education activities.},

abstract = {Workplace learning often requires workers to learn new perceptual and motor skills. The future of work will increasingly feature human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants, where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized experiment (n = 140), we found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy, with the goal of obtaining additional training labels that can be used for fine-tuning the machine. A simulation study illustrates how even noisy labels can increase the machine’s accuracy.},

While moments of crisis expose the vulnerabilities and injustices underlying this system, this paper seeks to explore which processes and tools CSCW could purposely design to 'open up' food infrastructures and bring young and adult people in contact with different aspects of the food system to cultivate food citizenship from a more-than-human perspective. Through a collaboration with a local primary school and four different food organisations (a mushroom grower, a vegetable farm, a bread-baking community centre, and a food bank) in North East England, UK, we designed 'contact zones' that enabled a class of students aged 7 to 8 years to encounter socio-material food practices at each partnering organisation's site and in the classroom. Our insights show young people's rich engagement in the socio-materiality of place, food, and practices; how encountering food practices across very different sites helped surface the interconnectedness of the food system; and how the contact zones opened spaces to practice food citizenship. The paper offers design implications towards infrastructuring more-than-human food pedagogies. It discusses inherent power dynamics of more-than-human design collaborations, critically evaluates the role of technology in more-than-human relations, and presents three design opportunities towards a relational understanding of food.},

Each dyad consisting of a parent and a teen, participated in nine weekly activities over a period of eight weeks, followed by an exit interview. The participants discussed their desires and fears, such as those regarding agency, emotion recognition, voice characteristics and forms, the timing of their interactions, and voice agents’ acting on behalf of others. The dyads appreciated the flexibility in participation, their ability to send responses privately to the researchers, their access to a channel for socializing with other participants, and the opportunity to build on ideas through sequential interactions during ARC activities. In the end, we discuss how our findings might inform the design of future voice agents and present recommendations for adapting ARC method while designing with parent-teen dyads.},

The authors have partnered with a grassroots food-sharing community, FoodSharing Copenhagen (FS-CPH), to reconsider queuing practices at food-sharing events. The results present three “queuing canvases” that illustrate how FS-CPH members envision digitally mediated queuing at food-sharing events. The paper outlines three themes that emerge from this design work: communicating activism through queuing, encountering others through queuing, and transparency in queuing mechanisms. We discuss how the envisioned ideas illustrate novel perspectives on queuing in volunteer-driven settings, while sometimes falling back on accepted norms and common expectations of how queuing should work. To address this, we present a set of sensitivities, for designers and activists alike, to design for queuing in settings where non-monetary sharing is central.},

In this case study, we introduce a framework for mapping three living lab principles to co-design stages within a single co-design framework and describe its use in innovating solutions for solid waste management on a university campus as a pre-cursor to scaling up the approach across the city. We present an evaluation of the framework in use against evidence of adherence to the three living lab principles of openness, empowerment of users, and realism.

By exploring the field of Human-Food interaction (HFI) – a sub-area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) which aims to investigate the diversity of ways people interact with food – we therefore specifically examine the design space of edible anthropomorphic virtual agents (EAVAs). To understand human-to-food interactive communication, we conducted an interview study with 19 participants, followed by a co-design workshop on the design of conversational agents for personified food. Based on the results, we implemented a prototype called FoodChattAR that employs augmented reality and chatbots to interact and communicate with food. Our evaluation with 21 participants shows that FoodChattAR turns eating into fun, while at the same time the food conveys relevant societal facts about itself. We contribute to the field of HCI by introducing EAVAs as a novel human-to-food interaction.},

We took the relative dearth of food-based interactive storytelling systems as an opportunity to explore a compelling design space for multisensory interactive narratives, given these few systems often position people only as passive observers. We report the results of a design workshop conducted among the authors who are design researchers in interactive narratives and food-based play. In the workshop, we discussed existing works, asynchronously brainstormed new food-based interactive storytelling systems, and then reconvened to discuss our ideas. We present the portfolio of designs that arose from this workshop, and the design themes that we synthesized from the portfolio. We recommend how to position people not just as observers, but as active participants in the interactive food-based storytelling system.},

abstract = {Moving to another country to study can be daunting and is connected to practical and emotional challenges. Here we present the results of an exploratory study on how smart textiles could be used to support international students in student housing to feel at home. We undertook seven situated interviews. Based on three key findings - the importance of social connections, cultural elements (food and carpets) and the limited duration of stay – the concept of a modular carpet with different interactive elements was developed. The carpet offers a social space, where students can spend time with friends. Its modularity allows personalization to the available space and room layout. With a proof of concept prototype we aim to open up a design space for tangible (textile) interventions.},

abstract = {This paper illustrates the multifaceted aspects of caring practices, and the ways they are entangled with the organizing of community-driven initiatives. Highlighting the situated inter-dependencies between concerns for care and efficiency, and considering caring practices as essential to the practical work that makes communities work, we reflect on how caring and efficiency rationalities frame the use, and scope the design of digital technologies. Drawing on two cases, the analysis shows the ways in which digital technologies oftentimes overshadow communities' key concerns for care, and how attempts to design for community settings can result in anti-designs, that is sociotechnical configurations that can disrupt caring practices. The contribution of the paper is twofold: first, an analysis of the different configurations of caring and efficiency and, second, a focus on care in the design and appropriation of technologies into this space.},

The findings inform a conceptual framework of designing for user experience leveraging eating experiences. These findings also inform implications for HFI design suggesting the value of multisensory flavor experiences, external and internal sensory stimulation and deprivation, aspects of eating for communicating meaning, and designing with contrasting pleasurable and uncomfortable experiences. The article concludes with six charts as novel generative design tools for HFI experiences focused on sensory, emotional, communicative, performative, and temporal experiences.},

The system aims to support awareness of our digestive processes and help users to make informed decisions about their dietary choices. Digestive Tumble consists of nine modules, where the modules visualise a unique stage of the digestion. The system represents the digestion of five major food groups: grains, meat, vegetables, fruits and dairy through colourful tokens. Users interact with the system by inserting tokens representing their meal. These tokens transform into colourful beads, which then traverse through different modules to show the digestion of the given meal. We reflect upon the steps involved in visualising an internal bodily process through a tangible system. We hope that our design reflection will inspire future systems on visualising other internal bodily processes to support body learning through everyday reflection.},

In recent years we have accordingly seen a growing interest in HCI to support users getting into more sustainable consumption practices. As part of this movement, we present in this paper a serious game called Face-the-Waste that is meant to increase users food literacy and educate them about the impact and development of food waste. Our serious game comes in the form of a public installation that uses provocative design to engage the users. They had to answer multiple choice questions and if they answered wrongly real food would be disposed into a bin in front of the users eyes. The aim with this was to create a strong emotional response and increase the level of reflection on the topic. In our evaluation we not only found that the users often voiced very strong emotional reactions but also engaged and discussed the question and their content. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such provocations can add a new layer for the design of serious games.},

In this work, we introduce a range of sustainable biomaterials (materials that are bio-based) that we use to create unique interactive interfaces. These biomaterials include ReClaym, a clay-like material made from compost; Alganyl, an algae-based bioplastic; Dinoflagellates, bioluminescent algae; SCOBY, symbiotic cultures of bacteria and yeast; and Spirulina, nutrient-dense blue-green algae. We describe how the implementation of these materials in our designs highlight the importance of utilizing materials that can biodegrade. We also call attention to the importance of care, patience, and understanding during the design processes to facilitate the creation of playful designs that respect the agency of each biomaterial. Lastly, we discuss the gained deeper sense of intimacy and understanding with our biomaterials which not only lead to more personally meaningful interfaces but more sustainable ones.},

Drawing on environmental studies, we outline key concepts of environmental stewardship – namely actors, capacity, and motivations – to unpack how different initiatives for handling waste are organised, both through grassroots and top-down interventions, and through varying sociotechnical configurations. We use these dimensions to analyse three different cases of waste management that illustrate how actions of care for the environment are ecologically organised, and what challenges might hinder them beyond –or besides– behavioural motivations. We conclude with a discussion on the orientation to action that the suggested framework provides, and its role in understanding, designing and assessing digital technologies in this domain. We argue that examining how stewardship actions fold into each other helps design sociotechnical interventions for managing waste from within a relational perspective.},

We combine our personal compost with non-toxic binders to create a biomaterial that can completely biodegrade. We propose Intimate Making as an approach for working with ReClaym that leverages familiar, hands-on techniques to enhance maker-material communication, which in turn leads to a deeper material understanding. We explore methods to customize ReClaym via color, texture, sensing, and conductivity. We apply manual fabrication techniques (sculpting, molding, and hand-held extruding) and design explorations to create a collection of applications that include garden paraphernalia, games, and personal items found in the home. We then examine the entire life cycle of ReClaym, which both begins and ends with composting—giving food waste a second life and providing a sustainable end of life for ReClaym artifacts, thus making the process truly circular.},

abstract = {Persuasive technologies are interactive systems that are designed to influence people to change their attitudes or behaviours. Persuasive technologies have been used successfully in several domains including health to make people exercise more, shopping to make people buy specific products, and social media to make people contribute better content. In the area of sustainability, its use is not well documented. To contribute to the use of persuasive technologies in sustainability, this paper carries out a literature review of published articles in the area in the past five years and summarizes the main findings based on three main themes: the design and development of the technology to make it adaptive to users, the evaluation of the technology, and the findings from the evaluation. Our results suggest that most persuasive technologies are developed as mobile applications, IoT devices or serious games and the most common behaviour change targeted by the persuasive technologies in this domain are energy conservation and sustainable food management. The most common persuasive strategies that are used are rewards, suggestions and self-monitoring. In terms of evaluation, a self-reported evaluation method was applied by most authors. While the range of evaluation of the developed persuasive technologies was between one hour and one year, the number of recruited participants ranged from two to over nine hundred. The findings from the evaluation were mostly mixed with several authors reporting positive results (behaviour change) for some participants. Based on these results, we suggest considerations for the development of future persuasive technologies for sustainability.},

Yet, it is still unclear what tools are at the disposal of designers who want to build systems that support reflection. Understanding the design space of reflection support systems and the interaction techniques that can foster reflection is necessary to enable building technologies that contribute to the users' well-being. In order to gain additional insight into how interactive artefacts foster reflection, we investigated past research prototypes and reflection-supporting smartphone applications (apps). Through a structured literature review and an analysis of app reviews, we constructed four design resources for reflection: temporal perspective, conversation, comparison and discovery. We also identified design patterns in past digital artefacts that implement the resources. Our work constitutes intermediate-level knowledge that is intended to inspire future technologies that better support reflection.},

They focus on promoting social, economic, and ecological sustainability within local communities. However, prior research uncovered emergent challenges of these communities that prevent their endurance and growth. Despite growing academic interest in studying these communities, designers found it difficult to effectively adopt newly generated knowledge in practice. Addressing the research-practice gap, we developed a translational resource for design practitioners to conceptualize new value-added features for supporting technologies in the sharing economy context. Specifically, we synthesized emergent challenges in non-profit sharing economy communities and key social and environmental sustainability efforts in design research into a familiar format for designers – the card-based toolkit to support generative design activities. Beyond introducing the toolkit, we offer a “how-to” guide for its adoption in collaborative settings.},

abstract = {Motivated by a desire for waste reduction through surplus redistribution, we explore the paradox of overproduction of resources that are wasted at several levels of the supply chain and the concurrent lack of access to, in most cases, overproduced basic resources by low income socioeconomic classes to whom resource access is normally only available through donation centers. To that end, we contrast two surplus redistribution solutions to this paradox. (1) Local independent donations between producers and donation centers. (2) Redistribution by way of a global redistributor (what we will call a core redistributor) who collects donations from all available producers and redistributes the surplus to all donation centers respective of their demanded quantities. We mathematically show that an optimal allocation of the surplus that minimizes waste and maximizes social welfare is only possible with a core redistributor. As this is a deeply social and economic problem rather than mathematical, we also qualitatively study two cases; (1) food waste and food insecurity in the UK, and (2) Los Angeles County’s project RoomKey: a pandemic effort to house covid-vulnerable unhoused persons in vacant hotels and motels. Both case studies give more support for a core redistribution as a solution to waste from overproduction and lack of access to essential resources.},

abstract = {Context: Means-end chains consist of a sequence of attributes, consequences, and values. These attributes can be understood as characteristics of a product; the consequences can be seen as benefits arising from this product’s use; the values represent the end goals important to the consumer or the motivation to use the product. Means-end chain analysis originates in marketing and relates consumers and products. In the context of systems, what drives a product to be accepted by users. Problem: To understand the application of the means-end theory in the IS area to identify factors that lead to user acceptance of a system. Solution: To conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to understand how means-end theory helped understand user acceptance of technology. IS Theory: This work was inspired by the Technology Acceptance Model Theory, which helps to determine an individual’s intention to use a system. Methodology adopted: The SLR searched for scientific articles published in the last five years that contained the keywords “means-end”, “technology adoption”, “technology acceptance”, “technology resistance”, “user adoption”, “user acceptance” and “user resistance”. The search was carried out in the databases of ACM, Elsevier (ScienceDirect), and IEEE, and also by Google Scholar. Summary of results: 13 articles were selected. From the analysis of these articles, we extracted guidelines on data collection, number of recommended participants, indicators of data reliability, and data analysis. Contribution and Impact in the IS area: The results can benefit further studies applying means-end theory for analysis and survey of software requirements, particularly considering the most important values for end users.},

abstract = {In the 2020s, world countries are called to take action to solve global issues, as defined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In our research, we are interested in exploring how Conversational Agents can be exploited to pursue the above goals, particularly in domestic spaces where CAs are becoming more and more popular. As a preliminary step in this research work, we organized a focus group with seven participants aimed at: i) investigating the potential of Conversational Agents - integrated with digital devices - to promote a more sustainable behavior at home; ii) eliciting the requirements on conversational interaction that such CAs should meet for this purpose. From the experience and findings of the focus group, we distilled a conceptual framework called CANDY, which highlights the core design dimension of Conversational Agents for Sustainability, and can be used to guide the processes of requirements elicitation and design for this category of CAs.},

abstract = {Multi-day music festivals have a waste problem with much of it centred around patron campgrounds. Interviews and co-design workshops were conducted with festival patrons (N = 19) and professionals (N = 9). The interviews indicated the factors impacting festival campground waste including the proliferation of cheap items, the continuity of management decisions, highly social camping practices, the land, and interactions between these. Co-design workshops explored these to produce sociotechnical strategies using the festival timeline as a frame, with one of these, a patron planning tool chosen for further development. This paper contributes new insights on how information and communication technologies might enhance sustainable practices by facilitating relational change through better organisation, evaluation, and feedback. It concludes with examination of the challenges and opportunities for Sustainable HCI, including how to carve out a design response to a wicked problem by situating relations, meaning making, telling invisible stories, and finding leverage points.},

Given the importance of food in our daily lives, we ask: how will our relationships with food be transformed by the metaverse, and what are the promises and pitfalls of this technology? To answer this, we propose a co-design study that reveals the important elements people value in their daily interactions with food. We then present a speculative catalogue of novel metaverse food experiences, and insights from discussing these ideas with food designers, anthropologists and metaverse experts. Our work aims to provide designers with inspirations for building a metaverse that: provides inclusive opportunities for the future of food; helps re-discover the forgotten or lost knowledge about food; facilitates the exploration, excitement and joy of eating; and reinvigorates the ways that food can soothe and heal.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing in China is a thriving industry. Among its most interesting structures, we find crowdfarms, in which crowdworkers self-organize as small organizations to tackle macrotasks. Little, however, is known as to which practices these crowdfarms use to tackle the macrotasks, and this goes hand in hand with the current practice of the HCI research community to treat all forms of complex crowdsourcing work as practically the same. However, macrotasks differ substantially regarding structure and decomposability. Treating them under one umbrella term - macrotasking - can lead to an imprecise understanding of the workforce involved. We address this gap by examining the work practices of 31 Chinese crowdfarms on the four main macrotask types, namely: modular, interlaced, wicked, and container macrotasks. Our results confirm essential differences in how these nascent crowd organizations address different macrotasks and shed light on what platforms can do to improve the uptake of such work.},

abstract = {Sustainable HCI and Human-Food-Interaction research have developing interest in preventing food waste through food sharing. Sustainability requires attention to both the opportunities and challenges associated with the building of food sharing groups engaged in the redistribution of food but also in developing a wider agenda which includes, for instance, the local production of food resources. In this paper, we argue for a better understanding of the different conceptions of ‘fairness’ which inform volunteer and guest practice and in turn mediate community-building efforts. We examine the practices surrounding ‘SharingEvent’ and challenges faced to sustainability by the heterogenous, and sometimes contested, commitments of the people involved. We further consider how ICT provided opportunities for explicit examination of ideological differences concerning what ‘sharing’ might mean. Our findings show that community building is dependent on the negotiation of different values and purposes identified. We derive recommendations for action-oriented researchers ultimately concerned with systemic transformation.},

abstract = {Food waste is a major source of greenhouse gases and contributes significantly to climate change. Compost Companion, or CoCo, is a wearable anthropomorphic device that uses a GPS system to track composting locations on a college campus to make reducing food waste easy for students. CoCo provides informational feedback on the amount of food that a user has composted or wasted, as well as emotional feedback through the wagging of its tail based on how well the user has been composting. Information including composting locations and amount of food discarded are displayed through an OLED screen, and tail wagging is operated by a Servo motor. CoCo was designed over several iterations based on feedback received from users through surveys, interviews and observations, as well as from subject matter experts through the Delphi method. Overall, findings suggest that CoCo is usable and creates enjoyable composting experiences for users through empathy.},

abstract = {Food waste in private households of industrialised countries is becoming an increasing concern, as its impact on greenhouse gas emissions is comparable to that of the aviation industry. One particular unnecessary contribution to food waste is a person forgetting which food items they have in their household, which often leads to food items expiring before they are used. This paper introduces FoodFighters a mobile serious game aimed at encouraging young adult players to interact with their food items thereby making them more memorable. FoodFighters works by taking pictures of food items, that then can be customized into so called Food Fighters, which are then used to battle other players/friends fighters. In two preliminary lab studies, we validated that Food Fighters actually improved retention of food items and found that players found the game enjoyable based on a GEQ-questionnaire.},

abstract = {The concept of self-reflection is investigated in a wide range of fields, from Psychology to HCI. Different fields use different methods to trigger reflection, such as visualizing accumulated personal quantitative data, personal photos, journaling, or asking reflective questions about experiences. This study combines photo-based journaling, reflective questions and data visualization for triggering momentary and retrospective self-reflection. We prototyped a photo-based journaling app and conducted a 5-week field study (N=13) to observe in-the-wild experiences. Following, we conducted an evaluation workshop (N=9) to explore strategies for motivating reflective question answering and retrospective self-reflection. Our approach encourages momentary and retrospective self-reflection, but the question-answering process could be burdensome and retrospective self-reflection should be incentivized. For that, we compiled design strategies for both kinds of self-reflection. We contribute to the HCI literature with strategies for unifying momentary and retrospective self-reflection in photo-based journaling.},

abstract = {In the post-epidemic era, online teaching has become a trend, and "workshop" as an important teaching practice method for design disciplines has also been moved online. The teaching format of the workshop is usually practice-oriented, and many factors such as geographical distance and time difference have a great influence on the development of online teaching activities. Taking the teaching practice of the POLAR International Workshop as an example, this study obtained detailed experience and suggestions on the practical process and activities of the workshop through one-to-one semi-structured interviews with the participants in the workshop. Card sorting was used to analyze the users' information data, from the results, an online design workshop construction model was extracted. This qualitative study focused on how to create an online design workshop with a better experience. The online design workshop construction model in the post-epidemic era should start with three aspects, which were workshop agenda advancement, design work development and teamwork communication, focusing on the experience and feelings of participants. This study provided a structured empirical reference and guidance framework for the development of online workshop teaching activities in design disciplines in the future.},

In this paper, we report on a Research through Design project aimed at designing and evaluating a data physicalization for supporting collective sense-making of the climate impact of food. Throughout the design process, we have explored the materiality of CO2 emissions and ways to design with less resource use. The resulting data physicalization, Carbon Scales, was evaluated in a three-week field study with 27 participants. Our findings show that collective sense-making can be enabled through interactive data physicalizations and that this can lead to carbon literacy. We expand on a) sustainability through design by arguing for the value of artifacts that let people stay in the interaction as this can support collective sense-making and b) sustainability in design by showcasing the value of designing with an interaction-first and materials-second mindset.},

abstract = {Microbes offer designers opportunities to endow artefacts with environmental sensing and adapting abilities, and unique expressions. However, microbe-embedded artefacts present a challenge of temporal dissonance, reflected by a “time lag” typically experienced by humans in noticing the gradual and minute shifts in microbial metabolism. This could compromise fluency of interactions and may hinder timely noticing and attending to microbes in living artefacts. In addressing this challenge, we introduce Cyano-chromic Interface, in which photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803) is timely surfaced by an electrochromic (EC) material through its monochromatic display. Grounded through interface performance characterization and design primitives, we developed application concepts through which we instantiate how the interface can be tuned for diverse functional and experiential outcomes in living artefacts. We further discuss the potential of aligning human-microbe temporalities for enriched interactions and reciprocal relationships with microbes, and beyond.},

PDPs offer a way to engage a community with data of personal relevance that otherwise would be intangible. However, their design space has only begun to be explored, and most prior work shows relatively simple encoding rules. Therefore, we present a design exploration of different ways of faceting contributed data: by week, day, or person. Specifically, we designed Edo, a PDP that allows a small community to contribute their data to a physical visualization showing the climate impact of their dietary choices. In this pictorial, we elaborate on the design process of Edo and reflect on the findings of a three-week deployment of different layouts of Edo.

abstract = {Communication between people is characterized by a broad range of nonverbal cues. Transferring these cues into the design of robots and other artificial agents that interact with people may foster more natural, inviting, and accessible experiences. In this article, we offer a series of definitive nonverbal codes for human–robot interaction (HRI) that address the five human sensory systems (visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and gustatory) drawn from the field of communication studies. We discuss how these codes can be translated into design patterns for HRI using a curated sample of the communication studies and HRI literatures. As nonverbal codes are an essential mode in human communication, we argue that integrating robotic nonverbal codes in HRI will afford robots a feeling of “aliveness” or “social agency” that would otherwise be missing. We end with suggestions for research directions to stimulate work on nonverbal communication within the field of HRI and improve communication between people and robots.},

abstract = {The ability to assess the quality of fruit and vegetables at scale can revolutionize the agriculture sector and significantly reduce food waste. In this paper, we present AgriTera, a novel solution for accurate non-invasive, and contract-free fruit ripeness sensing via sub-terahertz wireless signals. The key idea is that sugar and water concentrations in fruit (that are associated with fruit ripening) leave unique non-uniform footprints in the wide band spectrum of the reflected signal off of the fruits. AgriTera utilizes the sub-THz bands for its wide bandwidth, sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the peel as well as the pulp underneath the peel. We develop a chemometric model that translates the reflection spectra to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We conduct extensive over-the-air experiments with commercially available sub-THz transceivers. We compare our results with ground truth values captured by a specialized quality sensor and a vision-based scheme that infers ripeness based on changes in the appearance of the fruit. We demonstrate that AgriTera can accurately estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruit with an average Normalized RMSE value of 0.55\%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceivable by the consumer.},

abstract = {We report from a project where students created animated public content to promote the urgency of climate change and encourage positive behavior change amongst a city's citizens and stakeholders. We worked with Newcastle City Council in the UK, whose Net Zero agenda has been formulated to mitigate and adapt to climate change, including by changing public perception and promoting more sustainable lifestyles. 32 final-year Animation and Interaction Design (IxD) undergraduate students worked in a collaborative design process to create seven site-specific public campaigns applying animation and projection mapping technologies. Educational challenges included working with new technology, delivering a professional quality result to an external client, and a short 8-week schedule. The results included an interactive game to engage the public in the concept of plastic bottle deposit recycling scheme; ‘guerilla’ projecting on a major clothing retail store intended to encourage passing shoppers to reflect on their role on the negative aspects of fast fashion; and an installation across some of the underground metro stations to highlight and celebrate the sustainability principles of public transport. Our contribution includes our case study of an agile structured collaborative process, with the dual focus of creating high-quality, engaging and site-specific creative content and promoting a specific aspect of the Council's policy agenda. Additionally, we discuss insights into tailoring projection mapping and animated content for civic communications purposes and encouraging digital animation students – who typically work on their production independently– to engage in collaborative processes and with civic responsibilities.},

We conducted a survey in the United Kingdom (22 responses) and a follow-up interview with 13 households to inform the design of interventions for reducing household consumption by: 1) understanding household consumption practices, and 2) identifying the concerns and challenges for household engagement with sustainability practices. Our findings highlight how the perspectives, understanding, and motives for consumption reduction actively shape household practices and their attempts to curtail consumption. Existing non-negotiable practices led to additional household consumption and we found different strategies households use to reach a shared-decision on food and energy use. Based on our findings, we provide opportunities for motivating and fostering engagement with sustainable practices at home.},

abstract = {Food waste presents a substantial challenge with significant environmental and economic ramifications, and its severity on campus environments is of particular concern. In response to this, we introduce FoodWise, a dual-component system tailored to inspire and incentivize campus communities to reduce food waste. The system consists of a data storytelling dashboard that graphically displays food waste information from university canteens, coupled with a mobile web application that encourages users to log their food waste reduction actions and rewards active participants for their efforts. Deployed during a two-week food-saving campaign at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in March 2023, FoodWise engaged over 200 participants from the university community, resulting in the logging of over 800 daily food-saving actions. Feedback collected post-campaign underscores the system’s efficacy in elevating user consciousness about food waste and prompting behavioral shifts towards a more sustainable campus. This paper also provides insights for enhancing our system, contributing to a broader discourse on sustainable campus initiatives.},

In this context, the supply chain has also quickly evolved toward the digital supply chain where digital and electronic technologies have been integrated into every aspect of its end-to-end process. This evolution provides numerous benefits such as profit maximization, loss reduction, and the optimization of supply chain lead times. However, the use of such technologies has also considerably opened up various security threats and risks which have widened the attack surface on the entire end-to-end supply chain. We present a holistic survey on supply chain security. We discuss the different security issues and attacks that target the different supply chain technologies. Then, we discuss various countermeasures and security solutions proposed by academic and industry researchers to mitigate the identified threats. Finally, we provide some recommendations and best practices that can be adopted to achieve a secure supply chain.},

However, we know little about which conceptual aspects of gamification and which gamified elements are actually used in the context of sustainable food apps. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse 76 mobile apps from the Google Play Store found with the term ‘sustainable food’ of which we analyse 27 apps in detail using the Gameful Design Heuristics. Our analysis uncovers a low average heuristics score and an unbalanced usage of subheuristics and heuristic categories. Additionally, gamification is unevenly distributed among food themes and sustainability categories. This study’s results contribute to the research on commercial gamified apps related to sustainability and food. Thus, this paper contributes to gamification design by identifying design opportunities that serve as interesting starting points for future work.},

However, it remains unarticulated how such research narratives are embedded in the design of digital technology for communal energy futures that are situated in everyday life. While sustainable HCI has identified relevant design narratives, little attention has been paid to those of communal energy projects. In this paper, we scope energy community literature at ACM to identify design narratives that tell stories about how energy communities are imagined and why they are relevant. Through a critical discourse analysis, we describe how design narratives currently shape energy community research on sites, participation, and digital technologies. We use these stories to discuss and suggest three trajectories of how future HCI researchers and practitioners may explore alternative and sustainable visions of energy community futures.},

Over the course of ten weeks, eight students and young professionals from a wide range of disciplines lived and worked together to build and self-experiment with technologies that integrate extended reality (XR), wearables, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and artificial intelligence (AI). Made possible by a residential community and interdisciplinary teams, this high-intensity model for HCI research and development (R&amp;D) was structured to encourage experimentation with atypical human-centered design methods and artistic practices. We present our program design, organization, and management, and discuss challenges and suggestions for improvements, to inspire future residencies as vehicles for intensive HCI innovation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a multiple-site case study to illustrate the similarities and differences in design with children in situated research contexts. The aim is to provide the reader with an insight into the planning, execution and evaluation of a set of linked, yet individual, studies from several different contexts and countries. The cases provide a platform to think about how design studies might be collectively reported and evaluated even when they are carried out in different ways. We illustrate the inherent complexity of this process by considering six case studies from five countries on three continents. The contribution is an illustration of differentiated replication in multiple distributed participatory design case studies with children in different countries. We share our thoughts on replication and differentiation, on the value of the design activities, and on how to carry out a larger project.},

abstract = {In Canada, nearly 40\% of university students experience food insecurity [1, 2]. However, most young adults and students are not aware or even underestimate the extent of the insecurity they face. This phenomenon can increase the cognitive burden associated with food management, leading to poor resource allocation exacerbating levels of food insecurity. This negatively impacts Sustainable Development Goal 2, 'Zero Hunger.' The Canadian government and university institutions have often relied on food banks or charitable organizations. However, these interventions have mainly served as emergency measures rather than long-term solutions [3]. Through research based on a design-adapted ethnographic approach, our team has gained a deep understanding of the situation of university students and the challenges related to food. Consequently, we propose CookNook: an application featuring an intelligent personal assistant aimed at helping users prioritize cooking time by reducing the cognitive load associated with food. This is accomplished by providing simple and accessible recipes, accompanied by shopping lists tailored to their resources, needs, and constraints. CookNook also facilitates culinary gatherings with friends to share meals while motivating them to cook more. In this article, we summarize our design process and how our solution represents a step towards ensuring sufficiently quality nutrition among university students.},

abstract = {Food waste is one of the greatest economic and ethical challenges in the world. Empowering consumers with the ability to assess the quality of fruit can be a game changer for reducing waste and motivating a healthier diet. In this paper, we present Meta-Sticker a novel low-cost non-invasive solution for accurate fruit sensing via a sub-THz metamaterial sticker. The key idea is to exploit fruit as a substrate for resonating meta-atoms. Changes in the chemical composite of the fruit over time (e.g., sugar and water concentration) yield variation in the dielectric properties of the fruit (here substrate). Interestingly, this would affect the resonant frequency of the Meta-Sticker. We design Meta-Sticker to resonate in the sub-THz bands for their sensitivity to water, mm-scale penetration depth, and non-ionizing features that offer high-resolution inferences from the inner pulp of the fruit. We develop a model that translates the resonance of Meta-Sticker to well-known ripeness metrics, namely Dry Matter and Brix. We fabricate Meta-Sticker on paper and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments. We demonstrate that our system can estimate Brix and Dry Matter in three different types of fruits with an average Normalized RMSE value of 1.24\%, an error that yields a negligible impact on taste and is imperceptible by the consumer. Our design is non-invasive, low-cost (less than a cent), passive, biodegradable, and conformal.},

abstract = {Food waste in private households in industrialized countries is a growing concern. Inadequate food storage practices can lead to storing items in a way that leads to forgetting them until they become spoiled, increasing food waste. In this paper, we present FridgeSort, a serious mobile game that aims at teaching users how to sort their refrigerators with the underlying goal of reducing household food waste. The game was evaluated with 14 participants, and the results show that the participants were able to quickly learn the sorting method and recall it after an extended period of time. Overall, the results suggest that FridgeSort succeeded in teaching users how to sort a fridge that can be applied to the real world and lead to a reduction in food waste.},

abstract = {The negative impact humans have on the environment is partly caused by thoughtless consumption leading to unnecessary waste. A likely contributing factor is the relative invisibility of waste: waste produced by individuals is either out of their sight or quickly taken away. Nevertheless, waste disposal systems sometimes break down, creating natural information displays of waste production that can have educational value. We take inspiration from such natural displays and introduce a class of situated visualizations we call augmented reality waste accumulation visualizations, or ARwavs, which are literal representations of waste data embedded in users’ familiar environment. We implemented examples of ARwavs and demonstrated them in feedback sessions with experts in pro-environmental behavior, and during a large tech exhibition event. We discuss general design considerations for ARwavs. Finally, we conducted a study with 20 participants suggesting that ARwavs yield stronger emotional responses than nonimmersive waste accumulation visualizations and plain numbers.},

The research employed various assessment tools, including initial and final assessments of English reading comprehension, alongside classroom observations. The reading scores were statistically analyzed using one-way ANCOVA. The findings of this investigation reveal that the treatment group exposed to the SDGs-based DS instruction exhibited better reading performance than the control group. Thus, using technology and integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the pedagogical framework offer distinct advantages in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction. This approach addresses the evolving educational landscape and caters to the multifaceted needs of contemporary learners..},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are fundamentally shaped by data, and building inclusive ML systems requires significant considerations around how to design representative datasets. Yet, few novice-oriented ML modeling tools are designed to foster hands-on learning of dataset design practices, including how to design for data diversity and inspect for data quality. To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. With Co-ML, beginners can build image classifiers through a distributed experience where data is synchronized across multiple devices, enabling multiple users to iteratively refine ML datasets in discussion and coordination with their peers. We deployed Co-ML in a 2-week-long educational AIML Summer Camp, where youth ages 13–18 worked in groups to build custom ML-powered mobile applications. Our analysis reveals how multi-user model building with Co-ML, in the context of student-driven projects created during the summer camp, supported development of DDPs including incorporating data diversity, evaluating model performance, and inspecting for data quality. Additionally, we found that students’ attempts to improve model performance often prioritized learnability over class balance. Through this work, we highlight how the combination of collaboration, model testing interfaces, and student-driven projects can empower learners to actively engage in exploring the role of data in ML systems.},

To address this issue, this study focuses on the risk assessment for the online food delivery services using the best-worst method and grey target decision method. Firstly, the influencing factors of online food delivery services’ risk are studied from the aspects of online food delivery platforms, restaurants, riders and customers. The risk factor system of online food delivery services is established according to the literature analysis method. Secondly, according to the characteristics of the risk, a risk assessment method combines best-worst method and grey target decision is constructed to measure the risk levels for different participants and risk factors. Finally, based on the risk assessment results, several decision schemes are proposed from the perspectives of participants. The grey target decision method is used to optimize the decision schemes, and after calculation, it is found that formulating the package standards to ensure food safety is the satisfactory decision scheme.},

abstract = {The packing process is a critical post-harvesting activity in table grape industry. Workers in packing stations are hired under seasonal contracts because of product seasonality and operations labor intensity. Seasonal workers, however, are usually characterized by inconsistent performance, high turnover and experience variation which leads to low productivity and high waste. Few mathematical models were used for evaluating fresh products packing operations, but in a deterministic nature which hinders the complexity and dynamics of the business processes. Hence, a hybrid Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) are employed to evaluate a set of seasonal recruiting policies in a large grape packing station. The paper aims to investigate the impact of workers experience on packing operations efficiency. The model outcomes demonstrate the improvement in operations efficiency and total running cost (about 20\% savings) that can be achieved when applying optimal recruiting policies that reduce labors variations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computational model designed for planning both implicit and explicit communication of intentions, goals, and desires. Building upon previous research focused on implicit communication of intention via actions, our model seeks to strategically influence an observer's belief using both the agent's actions and explicit messages. We show that our proposed model can be considered to be a special case of general multi-agent problems with explicit communication under certain assumptions. Since the mental state of the observer depends on histories, computing a policy for the proposed model amounts to optimizing a non-Markovian objective, which we show to be intractable in the worst case. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a technique based on splitting domain and communication actions during planning. We conclude with experimental evaluations of the proposed approach that illustrate its effectiveness},
